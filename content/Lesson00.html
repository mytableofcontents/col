            <div class="commentary introduction">
                <p><line>In</line> Christ’s parable teaching the same <line>principle</line> is seen as in His own mission <line>to</line> the world. That we might become <line>acquainted</line> with His divine character <line>and</line> life, Christ took our nature and <line>dwelt</line> among us. Divinity was revealed <line>in</line> humanity; the invisible glory in the <line>visible</line> human form. Men could learn <line>of</line> the unknown through the known; <line>heavenly</line> things were revealed through <line>the</line> earthly; God was made manifest <line>in</line> the likeness of men. So it was in <line>Christ’s</line> teaching: the unknown was <line>illustrated</line> by the known; divine truths <line>by</line> earthly things with which the <line>people</line> were most familiar.</p>
                <p><line>The</line> Scripture says, “All these things <line>spake</line> Jesus unto the multitude in <line>parables;</line> . . . that it might be fulfilled <line>which</line> was spoken by the prophet, <line>saying,</line> I will open My mouth in <line>parables;</line> I will utter things which <line>have</line> been kept secret from the found- <line>ation</line> of the world.” Matthew 13:34,35. <line>Natural</line> things were the medium for <line>the</line> spiritual; the things of nature and <line>the</line> life-experience of His hearers were <line>connected</line> with the truths of the written <line>word.</line> Leading thus from the natural to <line>the</line> spiritual kingdom, Christ’s parables <line>are</line> links in the chain of truth that unites <line>man</line> with God, and earth with heaven.</p>
                <p><line>In</line> His teaching from nature, Christ <line>was</line> speaking of the things which His <line>own</line> hands had made, and which had <line>qualities</line> and powers that He Himself <line>had</line> imparted. In their original perfect- <line>ion</line> all created things were an expression <line>of</line> the thought of God. To Adam and <line>Eve</line> in their Eden home nature was <line>full</line> of the knowledge of God, teeming <line>with</line> divine instruction. Wisdom spoke <line>to</line> the eye and was received into the <line>heart;</line> for they communed with God <line>in</line> His created works. As soon as the <line>holy</line> pair transgressed the law of the <line>Most</line> High, the brightness from the <line>face</line> of God departed from the face of <line>nature.</line> The earth is now marred and <line>defiled</line> by sin. Yet even in its blighted <line>state</line> much that is beautiful remains. <line>God’s</line> object lessons are not obliterated; <line>rightly</line> understood, nature speaks of <line>her</line> Creator.</p>
                <p><line>In</line> the days of Christ these lessons had <line>been</line> lost sight of. Men had well-nigh <line>ceased</line> to discern God in His works. <line>The</line> sinfulness of humanity had cast <line>a</line> pall over the fair face of creation; <line>and</line> instead of manifesting God, His <line>works</line> became a barrier that concealed <line>Him.</line> Men “worshiped and served the <line>creature</line> more than the Creator.” Thus <line>the</line> heathen “became vain in their <line>imaginations,</line> and their foolish heart <line>was</line> darkened.” Romans 1:25, 21. So in <line>Israel,</line> man’s teaching had been put in <line>the</line> place of God’s. Not only the things <line>of</line> nature, but the sacrificial service <line>and</line> the Scriptures themselves–all given <line>to</line> reveal God–were so perverted that they <line>became</line> the means of concealing Him. <line>Christ</line> sought to remove that which <line>obscured</line> the truth. The veil that sin <line>has</line> cast over the face of nature, He <line>came</line> to draw aside, bringing to view <line>the</line> spiritual glory that all things were <line>created</line> to reflect. His words placed the <line>teachings</line> of nature as well as of the <line>Bible</line> in a new aspect, and made them <line>a</line> new revelation.</p>
                <p><line>Jesus</line> plucked the beautiful lily, and <line>placed</line> it in the hands of children and <line>youth;</line> and as they looked into His own <line>youthful</line> face, fresh with the sunlight <line>of</line> His Father’s countenance, He gave <line>the</line> lesson, “Consider the lilies of the <line>field,</line> how they grow [in the simplicity <line>of</line> natural beauty]; they toil not, neither <line>do</line> they spin; and yet I say unto you, <line>that</line> even Solomon in all his glory was <line>not</line> arrayed like one of these.” Then <line>followed</line> the sweet assurance and the <line>important</line> lesson, “Wherefore, if God <line>so</line> clothe the grass of the field, which <line>today</line> is, and tomorrow is cast into the <line>oven,</line> shall He not much more clothe <line>you,</line> O ye of little faith?”</p>
                <p><line>In</line> the sermon on the mount these words <line>were</line> spoken to others besides children <line>and</line> youth. They were spoken to the <line>multitude,</line> among whom were men and <line>women</line> full of worries and perplexities, <line>and</line> sore with disappointment and <line>sorrow.</line> Jesus continued: “Therefore <line>take</line> no thought, saying, What shall <line>we</line> eat? or, What shall we drink? or, <line>Wherewithal</line> shall we be clothed? <line>(for</line> after all these things do the <line>Gentiles</line> seek:) for your Heavenly Father <line>knoweth</line> that ye have need of all these <line>things.”</line> Then spreading out His hands <line>to</line> the surrounding multitude, He said, <line>“But</line> seek ye first the kingdom of <line>God,</line> and His righteousness; and all <line>these</line> things shall be added unto you.” Matt. 6:28-33.</p>
                <p><line>Thus</line> Christ interpreted the message <line>which</line> He Himself had given to the <line>lilies</line> and the grass of the field. He <line>desires</line> us to read it in every lily and <line>every</line> spire of grass. His words are <line>full</line> of assurance, and tend to confirm <line>trust</line> in God.</p>
                <p><line>So</line> wide was Christ’s view of truth, <line>so</line> extended His teaching, that every <line>phase</line> of nature was employed in <line>illustrating</line> truth. The scenes upon <line>which</line> the eye daily rests were all <line>connected</line> with some spiritual truth, so <line>that</line> nature is clothed with the parables <line>of</line> the Master.</p>
                <p><line>In</line> the earlier part of His ministry, Christ <line>had</line> spoken to the people in words so <line>plain</line> that all His hearers might have <line>grasped</line> truths which would make them <line>wise</line> unto salvation. But in many hearts <line>the</line> truth had taken no root, and it had <line>been</line> quickly caught away. “Therefore <line>speak</line> I to them in parables.” He said; <line>“because</line> they seeing see not; and <line>hearing</line> they hear not, neither do they <line>understand.</line> . . . For this people’s heart <line>is</line> waxed gross, and their ears are dull <line>of</line> hearing, and their eyes they have <line>closed.”</line> Matt. 13:13-15.</p>
                <p><line>Jesus</line> desired to awaken inquiry. He <line>sought</line> to arouse the careless, and <line>impress</line> truth upon the heart. Parable <line>teaching</line> was popular, and command- <line>ed</line> the respect and attention, not only <line>of</line> the Jews, but of the people of other <line>nations.</line> No more effective method of <line>instruction</line> could He have employed. <line>If</line> His hearers had desired a knowledge <line>of</line> divine things, they might have <line>understood</line> His words; for He was <line>always</line> willing to explain them to the <line>honest</line> inquirer.</p>
                <p><line>Again,</line> Christ had truths to present <line>which</line> the people were unprepared <line>to</line> accept or even to understand. For <line>this</line> reason also He taught them in <line>parables.</line> By connecting His teaching <line>with</line> the scenes of life, experience, or <line>nature,</line> He secured their attention and <line>impressed</line> their hearts. After-ward, <line>as</line> they looked upon the objects that <line>illustrated</line> His lessons, they recalled the <line>words</line> of the divine Teacher. To minds <line>that</line> were open to the Holy Spirit, the <line>significance</line> of the Saviour’s teaching <line>unfolded</line> more and more. Mysteries <line>grew</line> clear, and that which had been <line>hard</line> to grasp became evident.</p>
                <p><line>Jesus</line> sought an avenue to every heart. <line>By</line> using a variety of illustrations, He <line>not</line> only presented truth in its different <line>phases,</line> but appealed to the different <line>hearers.</line> Their interest was aroused by <line>figures</line> drawn from the surroundings of <line>their</line> daily life. None who listened to <line>the</line> Saviour could feel that they were <line>neglected</line> or forgotten. The humblest, <line>the</line> most sinful, heard in His teaching <line>a</line> voice that spoke to them in sympathy <line>and</line> tenderness.</p>
                <p><line>And</line> He had another reason for teaching <line>in</line> parables. Among the multitudes <line>that</line> gathered about Him, there were <line>priests</line> and rabbis, scribes and elders, <line>Herodians</line> and rulers, world-loving, <line>bigoted,</line> ambitious men, who desired <line>above</line> all things to find some accusation <line>against</line> Him. Their spies followed His <line>steps</line> day after day, to catch from His <line>lips</line> something that would cause His <line>condemnation,</line> and forever silence the <line>One</line> who seemed to draw the world <line>after</line> Him. The Saviour understood <line>the</line> character of these men, and He <line>presented</line> truth in such a way that they <line>could</line> find nothing by which to bring <line>His</line> case before the Sanhedrim.</p>
                <p><line>In</line> parables He rebuked the hypocrisy <line>and</line> wicked works of those who <line>occupied</line> high positions, and in <line>figurative</line> language clothed truth of <line>so</line> cutting a character that had it been <line>spoken</line> in direct denunciation, they <line>would</line> not have listened to His words, <line>and</line> would speedily have put an end to <line>His</line> ministry. But while He evaded the <line>spies,</line> He made truth so clear that error <line>was</line> manifested, and the honest in heart <line>were</line> profited by His lessons. Divine <line>wisdom,</line> infinite grace, were made plain <line>by</line> the things of God’s creation. Through <line>nature</line> and the experiences of life, men <line>were</line> taught of God. “The invisible things <line>of</line> Him since the creation of the world,” <line>were</line> “perceived through the things that <line>are</line> made, even His everlasting power <line>and</line> divinity.” Rom. 1:20, RV</p>
                <p><line>In</line> the Saviour’s parable teaching is <line>an</line> indication of what constitutes the <line>true</line> “higher education.” Christ might <line>have</line> opened to men the deepest truths <line>of</line> science. He might have unlocked <line>mysteries</line> which have required many <line>centuries</line> of toil and study to penetrate. <line>He</line> might have made suggestions <line>in</line> scientific lines that would have <line>afforded</line> food for thought and stimulus <line>for</line> invention to the close of time. But <line>He</line> did not do this. He said nothing to <line>gratify</line> curiosity, or to satisfy man’s <line>ambition</line> by opening doors to worldly <line>greatness.</line> In all His teaching, Christ <line>brought</line> the mind of man in contact <line>with</line> the Infinite Mind. He did not <line>direct</line> the people to study men’s <line>theories</line> about God, His word, or His <line>works.</line> He taught them to behold Him <line>as</line> manifested in His works, in His <line>word,</line> and by His providence.</p>
                <p><line>Christ</line> did not deal in abstract theories, <line>but</line> in that which is essential to the <line>development</line> of character, that which <line>will</line> enlarge man’s capacity for knowing <line>God,</line> and increase his efficiency to do <line>good.</line> He spoke to men of those truths <line>that</line> relate to the conduct of life, and <line>that</line> take hold upon eternity. <line>It</line> was Christ who directed the <line>education</line> of Israel. Concerning the <line>commandments</line> and ordinances of <line>the</line> Lord He said, “Thou shalt teach <line>them</line> diligently unto thy children, <line>and</line> shalt talk of them when thou <line>sittest</line> in thine house, and when thou <line>walkest</line> by the way, and when thou <line>liest</line> down, and when thou risest up. <line>And</line> thou shalt bind them for a sign <line>upon</line> thine hand, and they shall be <line>as</line> frontlets between thine eyes. <line>And</line> thou shalt write them upon <line>the</line> posts of thy house, and on thy <line>gates.”</line> Deuteronomy 6:7-9. In His <line>own</line> teaching, Jesus showed how <line>this</line> command is to be fulfilled–how <line>the</line> laws and principles of God’s <line>kingdom</line> can be so presented as to <line>reveal</line> their beauty and preciousness. <line>When</line> the Lord was training Israel <line>to</line> be the special representatives of <line>Himself,</line> He gave them homes among <line>the</line> hills and valleys. In their home <line>life</line> and their religious service they <line>were</line> brought in constant contact with <line>nature</line> and with the word of God. So <line>Christ</line> taught His disciples by the lake, <line>on</line> the mountainside, in the fields and <line>groves,</line> where they could look upon the <line>things</line> of nature by which He illustrated <line>His</line> teachings. And as they learned of <line>Christ,</line> they put their knowledge to <line>use</line> by cooperating with Him in His work.</p>
                <p><line>So</line> through the creation we are to <line>become</line> acquainted with the Creator. <line>The</line> book of nature is a great lesson <line>book,</line> which in connection with the <line>Scriptures</line> we are to use in teaching <line>others</line> of His character, and guiding <line>lost</line> sheep back to the fold of God. <line>As</line> the works of God are studied, the <line>Holy</line> Spirit flashes conviction into <line>the</line> mind. It is not the conviction that <line>logical</line> reasoning produces; but unless <line>the</line> mind has become too dark to know <line>God,</line> the eye too dim to see Him, the <line>ear</line> too dull to hear His voice, a deeper <line>meaning</line> is grasped, and the sublime, <line>spiritual</line> truths of the written word are <line>impressed</line> on the heart.</p>
                <p><line>In</line> these lessons direct from nature, <line>there</line> is a simplicity and purity that <line>makes</line> them of the highest value. All <line>need</line> the teaching to be derived from <line>this</line> source. In itself the beauty of <line>nature</line> leads the soul away from sin <line>and</line> worldly attractions, and toward <line>purity,</line> peace, and God. Too often <line>the</line> minds of students are occupied <line>with</line> men’s theories and speculations, <line>falsely</line> called science and philosophy. <line>They</line> need to be brought into close <line>contact</line> with nature. Let them learn <line>that</line> creation and Christianity have <line>one</line> God. Let them be taught to see <line>the</line> harmony of the natural with the <line>spiritual.</line> Let everything which their <line>eyes</line> see or their hands handle be made <line>a</line> lesson in character building. Thus the <line>mental</line> powers will be strengthened, <line>the</line> character developed, the whole <line>life</line> ennobled.</p>
                <p><line>Christ’s</line> purpose in parable teaching <line>was</line> in direct line with the purpose <line>of</line> the Sabbath. God gave to men the <line>memorial</line> of His creative power, that <line>they</line> might discern Him in the works of <line>His</line> hand. The Sabbath bids us behold <line>in</line> His created works the glory of the <line>Creator.</line> And it was because He desired <line>us</line> to do this that Jesus bound up His <line>precious</line> lessons with the beauty of <line>natural</line> things. On the holy rest day, <line>above</line> all other days, we should study <line>the</line> messages that God has written <line>for</line> us in nature. We should study the <line>Saviour’s</line> parables where He spoke <line>them,</line> in the fields and groves, under <line>the</line> open sky, among the grass and <line>flowers.</line> As we come close to the heart <line>of</line> nature, Christ makes His presence <line>real</line> to us, and speaks to our hearts of <line>His</line> peace and love.</p>
                <p><line>And</line> Christ has linked His teaching, <line>not</line> only with the day of rest, but with <line>the</line> week of toil. He has wisdom for <line>him</line> who drives the plow and sows the <line>seed.</line> In the plowing and sowing, the <line>tilling</line> and reaping, He teaches us to <line>see</line> an illustration of His work of grace <line>in</line> the heart. So in every line of useful <line>labor</line> and every association of life, He <line>desires</line> us to find a lesson of divine <line>truth.</line> Then our daily toil will no longer <line>absorb</line> our attention and lead us to <line>forget</line> God; it will continually remind <line>us</line> of our Creator and Redeemer. The <line>thought</line> of God will run like a thread <line>of</line> gold through all our homely cares <line>and</line> occupations. For us the glory of <line>His</line> face will again rest upon the face <line>of</line> nature. We shall ever be learning <line>new</line> lessons of heavenly truth, and <line>growing</line> into the image of His purity. <line>Thus</line> shall we “be taught of the Lord”; <line>and</line> in the lot wherein we are called, <line>we</line> shall “abide with God.” Isa. 54:13; <line>1 Cor.</line> 7:24.</p>

                    <span style="color:black;">Christ’s Object Lessons</span> was written by E.G. White and originally published in
                    1900 by Pacific Press Publishing Company. The subject matter is the parables of
                    Christ – His method of revealing spiritual insight through practical life examples.
                    Its Bible-based, Christ-centered, life-changing content has led a multitude to a
                    greater understanding of the kingdom of heaven.

                    <span style="color:black;">Seeds of Wisdom</span> is the first in a series of three Bible study guides. The other guides in this series are Growing
                    in Wisdom (#2) and Harvest of Wisdom (#3). Since each guide is based on a
                    unique set of parables, they can be utilized in sequence, out of sequence, or
                    independently.
