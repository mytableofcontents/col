But Abel came with <line>the</line> blood that pointed to the Lamb of <line>God.</line> He came as a sinner, confessing <line>himself</line> lost; his only hope was the <line>unmerited</line> love of God. The Lord had <line>respect</line> to his offering, but to Cain <line>and</line> his offering He had not respect. <line>The</line> sense of need, the recognition of <line>our</line> poverty and sin, is the very first <line>condition</line> of acceptance with God. <line>“Blessed</line> are the poor in spirit; for theirs <line>is</line> the kingdom of heaven.” Matt. 5:3.</p>

                <p><line>For</line> each of the classes represented by <line>the</line> Pharisee and the publican there is a <line>lesson</line> in the history of the apostle Peter. <line>In</line> his early discipleship Peter thought <line>himself</line> strong. Like the Pharisee, in his <line>own</line> estimation he was “not as other <line>men</line> are.” When Christ on the eve of <line>His</line> betrayal forewarned His disciples, <line>“All</line> ye shall be offended because of Me <line>this</line> night,” Peter confidently declared, <line>“Although</line> all shall be offended, yet will <line>not</line> I.” Mark 14:27, 29. Peter did not <line>know</line> his own danger. Self-confidence <line>misled</line> him. He thought himself able to <line>withstand</line> temptation; but in a few short <line>hours</line> the test came, and with cursing <line>and</line> swearing he denied his Lord.</p>

                <p><line>The</line> work of redemption involves <line>consequences</line> of which it is difficult for <line>man</line> to have any conception. “Eye hath <line>not</line> seen, nor ear heard, neither have <line>entered</line> into the heart of man, the things <line>which</line> God hath prepared for them that <line>love</line> Him.” 1 Cor. 2:9. As the sinner, <line>drawn</line> by the power of Christ, approaches <line>the</line> uplifted cross, and prostrates himself <line>before</line> it, there is a new creation. A new <line>heart</line> is given him. He becomes a new <line>creature</line> in Christ Jesus. Holiness finds <line>that</line> it has nothing more to require. <line>God</line> Himself is “the justifier of him <line>which</line> believeth in Jesus.” Rom. 3:26. <line>And</line> “whom He justified, them He also <line>glorified.”</line> Rom. 8:30. Great as is the <line>shame</line> and degradation through sin, even <line>greater</line> will be the honor and exaltation <line>through</line> redeeming love. To human <line>beings</line> striving for conformity to the <line>divine</line> image there is imparted an outlay <line>of</line> heaven’s treasure, an excellency of <line>power,</line> that will place them higher than <line>even</line> the angels who have never fallen. <line>“Thus</line> saith the Lord, the Redeemer of <line>Israel,</line> and His Holy One, to him whom <line>man</line> despiseth, to him whom the nation <line>abhorreth,</line> . . . Kings shall see and arise, <line>princes</line> also shall worship, because of <line>the</line> Lord that is faithful, and the Holy <line>One</line> of Israel, and He shall choose thee.” <line>Isa.</line> 49:7. “For every one that exalteth <line>himself</line> shall be abased; and he that <line>humbleth</line> himself shall be exalted.”</p>
