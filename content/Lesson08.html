<p><line>From</line> the work of seed sowing and <line>the</line> growth of the plant from the seed, <line>precious</line> lessons may be taught in the <line>family</line> and the school. Let the children <line>and</line> youth learn to recognize in natural <line>things</line> the working of divine agencies, <line>and</line> they will be enabled to grasp by <line>faith</line> unseen benefits. As they come to <line>understand</line> the wonderful work of God <line>in</line> supplying the wants of His great <line>family,</line> and how we are to cooperate <line>with</line> Him, they will have more faith in <line>God,</line> and will realize more of His power <line>in</line> their own daily life.</p></div>

<p><line>God</line> created the seed, as He created the <line>earth,</line> by His word. By His word He <line>gave</line> it power to grow and multiply. He <line>said,</line> “Let the earth bring forth grass, <line>the</line> herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree <line>yielding</line> fruit after his kind, whose seed <line>is</line> in itself, upon the earth; and it was <line>so.</line> . . : And God saw that it was good.” <line>Gen.</line> 1:11, 12. It is that word which still <line>causes</line> the seed to grow. Every seed that <line>sends</line> up its green blade to the sunlight <line>declares</line> the wonderworking power of <line>that</line> word uttered by Him who “spake, <line>and</line> it was”; who “commanded, and it <line>stood</line> fast.” Ps. 33:9.</p></div>

<p><line>Christ</line> taught His disciples to pray <line>“Give</line> us this day our daily bread.” <line>And</line> pointing to the flowers He gave <line>them</line> the assurance, “If God so clothe <line>the</line> grass of the field, . . . shall He not <line>much</line> more clothe you?” Matt. 6:11, 30. <line>Christ</line> is constantly working to answer <line>this</line> prayer, and to make good this <line>assurance.</line> There is an invisible power <line>constantly</line> at work as man’s servant to <line>feed</line> and to clothe him. Many agencies <line>our</line> Lord employs to make the seed, <line>apparently</line> thrown away, a living plant. <line>And</line> He supplies in due proportion all <line>that</line> is required to perfect the harvest. <line>In</line> the beautiful words of the psalmist: <line>“Thou</line> visitest the earth, and waterest <line>it;</line> Thou greatly enrichest it; The river <line>of</line> God is full of water; Thou providest <line>them</line> corn when Thou hast so prepared <line>the</line> earth.

<p><line>The</line> material world is under God’s <line>control.</line> The laws of nature are obeyed <line>by</line> nature. Everything speaks and <line>acts</line> the will of the Creator. Cloud <line>and</line> sunshine, dewand rain, wind and <line>storm,</line> all are under the supervision <line>of</line> God, and yield implicit obedience <line>to</line> His command. It is in obedience to <line>the</line> law of God that the spire of grain <line>bursts</line> through the ground, “first the <line>blade,</line> then the ear, after that the full <line>corn</line> in the ear.” Mark 4:28. These the <line>Lord</line> develops in their proper season <line>because</line> they do not resist His working. <line>And</line> can it be that man, made in the <line>image</line> of God, endowed with reason <line>and</line> speech, shall alone be unapprecia- <line>tive</line> of His gifts and disobedient to <line>His</line> will?

<p><line>In</line> everything that tends to the sustenance <line>of</line> man is seen the concurrence of <line>divine</line> and human effort. There can <line>be</line> no reaping unless the human hand <line>acts</line> its part in the sowing of the <line>seed.</line> But without the agencies which <line>God</line> provides in giving sunshine and <line>showers,</line> dew and clouds, there would <line>be</line> no increase. Thus it is in every <line>business</line> pursuit, in every department of <line>study</line> and science. Thus it is in spiritual <line>things,</line> in the formation of the character, <line>and</line> in every line of Christian work. We <line>have</line> a part to act, but we must have the <line>power</line> of divinity to unite with us, or <line>our</line> efforts will be in vain.</p></div>

<p><line>Whenever</line> man accomplishes any-thing, <line>whether</line> in spiritual or in temporal lines, <line>he</line> should bear in mind that he does it <line>through</line> cooperation with his Maker. <line>There</line> is great necessity for us to realize <line>our</line> dependence on God.

There <line>is</line> too little confidence in the power <line>which</line> God stands ready to give. “We <line>are</line> laborers together with God.” 1 Cor. <line>3:9.</line> Immeasurably inferior is the part <line>which</line> the human agent sustains; but if <line>he</line> is linked with the divinity of Christ, <line>he</line> can do all things through the strength <line>that</line> Christ imparts.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> gradual development of the plant <line>from</line> the seed is an object lesson in <line>child</line> training. There is “first the blade, <line>then</line> the ear, after that the full corn <line>in</line> the ear.” He who gave this parable <line>created</line> the tiny seed, gave it its vital <line>properties,</line> and ordained the laws that <line>govern</line> its growth. And the truths which <line>the</line> parable teaches were made a living <line>reality</line> in His own life. In both His <line>physical</line> and His spiritual nature He <line>followed</line> the divine order of growth <line>illustrated</line> by the plant, as He wishes <line>all</line> youth to do. Although He was the <line>Majesty</line> of heaven, the King of glory, <line>He</line> became a babe in Bethlehem, and <line>for</line> a time represented the helpless <line>infant</line> in its mother’s care. In childhood <line>He</line> did the works of an obedient child. <line>He</line> spoke and acted with the wisdom <line>of</line> a child and not of a man, honoring <line>His</line> parents and carrying out their <line>wishes</line> in helpful ways, according to <line>the</line> ability of a child. But at each stage <line>of</line> His development He was perfect, <line>with</line> the simple, natural grace of a <line>sinless</line> life. The sacred record says <line>of</line> His childhood, “The child grew, <line>and</line> waxed strong in spirit, filled with <line>wisdom;</line> and the grace of God was <line>upon</line> Him.” And of His youth it is <line>recorded,</line> “Jesus increased in wisdom <line>and</line> stature, and in favor with God and <line>man.”</line> Luke 2:40, 52.</p><p><line>The</line> work of parents and teachers <line>is</line> here suggested. They should aim <line>so</line> to cultivate the tendencies of the <line>youth</line> that at each stage of their life <line>they</line> may represent the natural beauty <line>appropriate</line> to that period, unfolding <line>naturally,</line> as do the plants in the garden.</p></div>

<p><line>In</line> the laws of God in nature, effect <line>follows</line> cause with unerring certainty. <line>The</line> reaping will testify as to what the <line>sowing</line> has been.

So in <line>spiritual</line> things: the faithfulness of <line>every</line> worker is measured by the results <line>of</line> his work. The character of his work, <line>whether</line> diligent or slothful, is revealed <line>by</line> the harvest. It is thus that his destiny <line>for</line> eternity is decided.</p><p><line>Every</line> seed sown produces a harvest of <line>its</line> kind. So it is in human life. We all <line>need</line> to sow the seeds of compassion, <line>sympathy,</line> and love; for we shall reap <line>what</line> we sow. Every characteristic <line>of</line> selfishness, self-love, self-esteem, <line>every</line> act of self-indulgence, will bring <line>forth</line> a like harvest.

<p><line>As</line> the seed sown produces a harvest, <line>and</line> this in turn is sown, the harvest is <line>multiplied.</line> In our relation to others, this <line>law</line> holds true. Every act, every word, <line>is</line> a seed that will bear fruit. Every deed <line>of</line> thoughtful kindness, of obedience, <line>or</line> of self-denial, will reproduce itself <line>in</line> others, and through them in still <line>others.</line> So every act of envy, malice, or <line>dissension</line> is a seed that will spring up <line>in</line> a “root of bitterness” (Heb. 12:15), <line>whereby</line> many shall be defiled.

<p><line>Liberality</line> both in spiritual and in <line>temporal</line> things is taught in the <line>lesson</line> of seed sowing. The Lord <line>says,</line> “Blessed are ye that sow beside <line>all</line> waters.” Isa. 32:20. “This I say, <line>He</line> which soweth sparingly shall <line>reap</line> also sparingly; and he which <line>soweth</line> bountifully shall reap also <line>bountifully.”</line> 2 Cor. 9:6. To sow <line>beside</line> all waters means a continual <line>imparting</line> of God’s gifts. It means <line>giving</line> wherever the cause of God or <line>the</line> needs of humanity demand our <line>aid.</line> This will not tend to poverty. <line>“He</line> which soweth bountifully shall <line>reap</line> also bountifully.” The sower <line>multiplies</line> his seed by casting it away. <line>So</line> it is with those who are faithful in <line>distributing</line> God’s gifts. By imparting <line>they</line> increase their blessings. God <line>has</line> promised them a sufficiency that <line>they</line> may continue to give. “Give, <line>and</line> it shall be given unto you; good <line>measure,</line> pressed down, and shaken <line>together,</line> and running over, shall men <line>give</line> into your bosom.” Luke 6:38.</p><p><line>And</line> more than this is wrapped up in the <line>sowing</line> and the reaping. As we distribute <line>God’s</line> temporal blessings, the evidence <line>of</line> our love and sympathy awakens in <line>the</line> receiver gratitude and thanksgiving <line>to</line> God. The soil of the heart is prepared <line>to</line> receive the seeds of spiritual truth. <line>And</line> He who ministers seed to the sower <line>will</line> cause the seed to germinate and bear <line>fruit</line> unto eternal life.</p></div>

<p><line>And</line> all who would bring forth fruit <line>as</line> workers together with Christ must <line>first</line> fall into the ground and die.

<p><line>Such</line> are a few of the many lessons <line>taught</line> by nature’s living parable of <line>the</line> sower and the seed. As parents and <line>teachers</line> try to teach these lessons, the <line>work</line> should be made practical. Let <line>the</line> children themselves prepare the <line>soil</line> and sow the seed. As they work, <line>the</line> parent or teacher can explain the <line>garden</line> of the heart with the good or bad <line>seed</line> sown there, and that as the garden <line>must</line> be prepared for the natural seed, <line>so</line> the heart must be prepared for the <line>seed</line> of truth. As the seed is cast into <line>the</line> ground, they can teach the lesson of <line>Christ’s</line> death; and as the blade springs <line>up,</line> they can teach the lesson of the <line>truth</line> of the resurrection. As the plants <line>grow,</line> the correspondence between the <line>natural</line> and the spiritual sowing may <line>be</line> continued.</p><p><line>The</line> youth should be instructed in a <line>similar</line> way. They should be taught to <line>till</line> the soil. It would be well if there <line>were,</line> connected with every school, <line>lands</line> for cultivation. Such lands should <line>be</line> regarded as God’s own schoolroom. <line>The</line> things of nature should be looked <line>upon</line> as a lesson book which His <line>children</line> are to study, and from which <line>they</line> may obtain knowledge as to the <line>culture</line> of the soul.</p></div>

<p><line>In</line> tilling the soil, in disciplining <line>and</line> subduing the land, lessons may <line>constantly</line> be learned. No one would <line>think</line> of settling upon a raw piece of <line>land,</line> expecting it at once to yield a <line>harvest.</line> Earnestness, diligence, and <line>persevering</line> labor are to be put forth in <line>treating</line> the soil preparatory to sowing <line>the</line> seed. So it is in the spiritual work <line>in</line> the human heart. Those who would <line>be</line> benefited by the tilling of the soil <line>must</line> go forth with the word of God <line>in</line> their hearts. They will then find the <line>fallow</line> ground of the heart broken by <line>the</line> softening, subduing influence of <line>the</line> Holy Spirit. Unless hard work is <line>bestowed</line> on the soil, it will not yield <line>a</line> harvest. So with the soil of the heart: <line>the</line> Spirit of God must work upon it <line>to</line> refine and discipline it before it can <line>bring</line> forth fruit to the glory of God.</p><p><line>The</line> soil will not produce its riches <line>when</line> worked by impulse. It needs <line>thoughtful,</line> daily attention. It must be <line>plowed</line> often and deep, with a view <line>to</line> keeping out the weeds that take <line>nourishment</line> from the good seed <line>planted.</line> Thus those who plow and <line>sow</line> prepare for the harvest. None need <line>stand</line> in the field amid the sad wreck <line>of</line> their hopes.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> blessing of the Lord will rest upon <line>those</line> thus work the land, learning <line>spiritual</line> lessons from nature. In <line>cultivating</line> the soil the worker knows <line>little</line> what treasures will open up before <line>him.</line> While he is not to despise the <line>instruction</line> he may gather from minds <line>that</line> have had an experience, and from <line>the</line> information that intelligent men <line>may</line> impart, he should gather lessons <line>for</line> himself.
