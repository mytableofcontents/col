<p><line>In</line> the multitude that listened to Christ’s <line>teaching</line> there were many Pharisees. <line>These</line> noted contemptuously how few <line>of</line> His hearers acknowledged Him <line>as</line> the Messiah. And they questioned <line>with</line> themselves how this unpretending <line>teacher</line> could exalt Israel to universal <line>dominion.</line> Without riches, power, or <line>honor,</line> how was He to establish the new <line>kingdom?</line> Christ read their thoughts <line>and</line> answered them: “Whereunto <line>shall</line> we liken the kingdom of God? <line>or</line> with what comparison shall we <line>compare</line> it?” In earthly governments <line>there</line> was nothing that could serve for <line>a</line> similitude. No civil society could af- <line>ford</line> Him a symbol. “It is like a grain of <line>mustard</line> seed,” He said, “which, when <line>it</line> is sown upon the earth, though it be <line>less</line> than all the seeds that are upon <line>the</line> earth, yet when it is sown, groweth <line>up,</line> and becometh greater than all the <line>herbs,</line> and putteth out great branches; <line>so</line> that the birds of the heaven can <line>lodge</line> under the shadow thereof.”</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> germ in the seed grows by the <line>unfolding</line> of the life-principle which <line>God</line> has implanted. Its development <line>depends</line> upon no human power. So it is <line>with</line> the kingdom of Christ. It is a new <line>creation.</line> Its principles of development <line>are</line> the opposite of those that rule <line>the</line> kingdoms of this world. Earthly <line>governments</line> prevail by physical force; <line>they</line> maintain their dominion by war; <line>but</line> the founder of the new kingdom is <line>the</line> Prince of Peace. The Holy Spirit <line>represents</line> worldly kingdoms under <line>the</line> symbol of fierce beasts of prey; but <line>Christ</line> is “the Lamb of God, which taketh <line>away</line> the sin of the world.” In His plan <line>of</line> government there is no employment <line>of</line> brute force to compel the conscience. <line>The</line> Jews looked for the kingdom of God <line>to</line> be established in the same way as <line>the</line> kingdoms of the world. To promote <line>righteousness</line> they resorted to external <line>measures.</line> They devised methods and <line>plans.</line> But Christ implants a principle. <line>By</line> implanting truth and righteousness, <line>He</line> counter works error and sin.</p></div>

<p><line>As</line> Jesus spoke this parable, the mustard <line>plant</line> could be seen far and near, lifting <line>itself</line> above the grass and grain, and <line>waving</line> its branches lightly in the air. <line>Birds</line> flitted from twig to twig, and <line>sang</line> amid the leafy foliage. Yet the <line>seed</line> from which sprang this giant plant <line>was</line> among the least of all seeds. At first <line>it</line> sent up a tender shoot, but it was of <line>strong</line> vitality, and grew and flourished <line>until</line> it reached its present great size. So <line>the</line> kingdom of Christ in its beginning <line>seemed</line> humble and insignificant. <line>Compared</line> with earthly kingdoms it <line>appeared</line> to be the least of all. By the <line>rulers</line> of this world Christ’s claim to be <line>a</line> king was ridiculed. Yet in the mighty <line>truths</line> committed to His followers <line>the</line> kingdom of the gospel possessed <line>a</line> divine life. And how rapid was its <line>growth,</line> how widespread its influence! <line>When</line> Christ spoke this parable, there <line>were</line> only a few Galilean peasants <line>to</line> represent the new kingdom. Their <line>poverty,</line> the fewness of their numbers, <line>were</line> urged over and over again as a <line>reason</line> why men should not connect <line>themselves</line> with these simpleminded <line>fishermen</line> who followed Jesus. But <line>the</line> mustard seed was to grow and <line>spread</line> forth its branches throughout <line>the</line> world. When the earthly kingdoms <line>whose</line> glory then filled the hearts of <line>men</line> should perish, the kingdom of <line>Christ</line> would remain, a mighty and <line>far-reaching</line> power.</p></div>

<p><line>Not</line> only is the growth of Christ’s <line>kingdom</line> illustrated by the parable of <line>the</line> mustard seed, but in every stage of <line>its</line> growth the experience represented in <line>the</line> parable is repeated. For His church <line>in</line> every generation God has a special <line>truth</line> and a special work. The truth <line>that</line> is hid from the worldly wise and <line>prudent</line> is revealed to the childlike and <line>humble.</line> It calls for self-sacrifice. It has <line>battles</line> to fight and victories to win. At <line>the</line> outset its advocates are few. By the <line>great</line> men of the world and by a world- <line>conforming</line> church, they are opposed <line>and</line> despised. See John the Baptist, the <line>forerunner</line> of Christ, standing alone to <line>rebuke</line> the pride and formalism of the <line>Jewish</line> nation. See the first bearers of the <line>gospel</line> into Europe. How obscure, how <line>hopeless,</line> seemed the mission of Paul and <line>Silas,</line> the two tent makers, as they with <line>their</line> companions took ship at Troas for <line>Philippi.</line> See “Paul the aged,” in chains, <line>preaching</line> Christ in the stronghold of <line>the</line> Caesars. See the little communities <line>of</line> slaves and peasants in conflict with <line>the</line> heathenism of imperial Rome. See <line>Martin</line> Luther withstanding that mighty <line>church</line> which is the masterpiece of the <line>world’s</line> wisdom. See him holding fast <line>God’s</line> word against emperor and pope, <line>declaring,</line> “Here I take my stand; I can <line>not</line> do otherwise. God be my help.” <line>See</line> John Wesley preaching Christ and <line>His</line> righteousness in the midst of <line>formalism,</line> sensualism, and infidelity. <line>See</line> one burdened with the woes of <line>the</line> heathen world, pleading for the <line>privilege</line> of carrying to them Christ’s <line>message</line> of love. Hear the response <line>of</line> ecclesiasticism: “Sit down, young <line>man.</line> When God wants to convert the <line>heathen,</line> He will do it without your <line>help</line> or mine.”</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> great leaders of religious thought <line>in</line> this generation sound the praises and <line>build</line> the monuments of those who <line>planted</line> the seed of truth centuries ago. <line>Do</line> not many turn from this work to <line>trample</line> down the growth springing <line>from</line> the same seed today? The old cry <line>is</line> repeated, “We know that God spake <line>unto</line> Moses; as for this fellow [Christ <line>in</line> the messenger He sends], we know <line>not</line> from whence he is.” John 9:29. As <line>in</line> earlier ages, the special truths for this <line>time</line> are found, not with the ecclesiast- <line>ical</line> authorities, but with men and <line>women</line> who are not too learned or too <line>wise</line> to believe the word of God.</p></div>

<p><line>And</line> in this last generation the parable <line>of</line> the mustard seed is to reach a signal <line>and</line> triumphant fulfillment. The little <line>seed</line> will become a tree. The last <line>message</line> of warning and mercy is to <line>go</line> to “every nation and kindred and <line>tongue”</line> (Rev. 14:6-14), “to take out <line>of</line> them a people for His name” (Acts <line>15:14;</line> Rev. 18:1). And the earth shall <line>be</line> lightened with His glory.</p></div>
