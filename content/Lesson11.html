<p><line>The</line> blessings of redeeming love our <line>Savior</line> compared to a precious pearl. <line>He</line> illustrated His lesson by the parable <line>of</line> the merchantman seeking goodly <line>pearls</line> “who, when he had found one <line>pearl</line> of great price, went and sold <line>all</line> that he had, and bought it.” Christ <line>Himself</line> is the pearl of great price. In <line>Him</line> is gathered all the glory of the <line>Father,</line> the fullness of the Godhead. He <line>is</line> the brightness of the Father’s glory <line>and</line> the express image of His person. <line>The</line> glory of the attributes of God is <line>expressed</line> in His character. Every page <line>of</line> the Holy Scriptures shines with His <line>light.</line> The righteousness of Christ, as <line>a</line> pure, white pearl, has no defect, no <line>stain.</line> No work of man can improve <line>the</line> great and precious gift of God. It is <line>without</line> a flaw. In Christ are “hid all the <line>treasures</line> of wisdom and knowledge.” <line>He</line> is “made unto us wisdom, and <line>righteousness,</line> and sanctification, and <line>redemption.”</line> 1 Cor. 1:30. All that can <line>satisfy</line> the needs and longings of the <line>human</line> soul, for this world and for the <line>world</line> to come, is found in Christ. Our <line>Redeemer</line> is the pearl so precious that <line>in</line> comparison all things else may be <line>accounted</line> loss.</p></div>

<p><line>But</line> not all were found indifferent to <line>the</line> gift of heaven. The merchantman in <line>the</line> parable represents a class who were <line>sincerely</line> desiring truth. In different <line>nations</line> there were earnest and thoughtful <line>men</line> who had sought in literature and <line>science</line> and the religions of the heathen <line>world</line> for that which they could receive <line>as</line> the soul’s treasure. Among the Jews <line>there</line> were those who were seeking for <line>that</line> which they had not. Dissatisfied with <line>a</line> formal religion, they longed for that <line>which</line> was spiritual and uplifting. Christ’s <line>chosen</line> disciples belonged to the latter <line>class,</line> Cornelius and the Ethiopian eunuch <line>to</line> the former. They had been longing <line>and</line> praying for light from heaven; and <line>when</line> Christ was revealed to them, they <line>received</line> Him with gladness.</p></div>

<p><line>In</line> the parable the pearl is not represented <line>as</line> a gift. The merchantman bought it <line>at</line> the price of all that he had. Many <line>question</line> the meaning of this, since <line>Christ</line> is represented in the Scriptures <line>as</line> a gift. He is a gift, but only to those <line>who</line> give themselves, soul, body, and <line>spirit,</line> to Him without reserve. We <line>are</line> to give ourselves to Christ, to live <line>a</line> life of willing obedience to all His <line>requirements.</line> All that we are, all the <line>talents</line> and capabilities we possess, are <line>the</line> Lord’s, to be consecrated to His <line>service.</line> When we thus give ourselves <line>wholly</line> to Him, Christ, with all the <line>treasures</line> of heaven, gives Himself to us. <line>We</line> obtain the pearl of great price.</p></div>

<p><line>Salvation</line> is a free gift, and yet it is to be <line>bought</line> and sold. In the market of which <line>divine</line> mercy has the management, the <line>precious</line> pearl is represented as being <line>bought</line> without money and without <line>price.</line> In this market all may obtain the <line>goods</line> of heaven. The treasury of the <line>jewels</line> of truth is open to all. “Behold, I <line>have</line> set before thee an open door,” the <line>Lord</line> declares, “and no man can shut <line>it.”</line> No sword guards the way through <line>this</line> door. Voices from within and at the <line>door</line> say, Come. The Saviour’s voice <line>earnestly</line> and lovingly invites us: “I <line>counsel</line> thee to buy of Me gold tried <line>in</line> the fire, that thou mayest be rich.” <line>Revelation</line> 3:8, 18.</p><p><line>The</line> gospel of Christ is a blessing that <line>all</line> may possess. The poorest are as well <line>able</line> as the richest to purchase salvation; <line>for</line> no amount of worldly wealth can <line>secure</line> it. It is obtained by willing <line>obedience,</line> by giving ourselves to Christ <line>as</line> His own purchased possession.</p></div>

<p><line>Education,</line> even of the highest class, <line>cannot</line> of itself bring a man nearer to <line>God.</line> The Pharisees were favored with <line>every</line> temporal and every spiritual <line>advantage,</line> and they said with boastful <line>pride,</line> We are “rich, and increased with <line>goods,</line> and have need of nothing”; yet <line>they</line> were “wretched, and miserable, <line>and</line> poor, and blind, and naked.” Christ <line>offered</line> them the pearl of great price; <line>but</line> they disdained to accept it, and He <line>said</line> to them, “The publicans and the <line>harlots</line> go into the kingdom of God <line>before</line> you.” Matthew 21:31.</p></div>

<p><line>We</line> cannot earn salvation, but we are <line>to</line> seek for it with as much interest <line>and</line> perseverance as though we would <line>abandon</line> everything in the world for it.</p><p><line>We</line> are to seek for the pearl of great <line>price,</line> but not in worldly marts or <line>in</line> worldly ways. The price we are <line>required</line> to pay is not gold or silver, for <line>this</line> belongs to God. Abandon the idea <line>that</line> temporal or spiritual advantages <line>will</line> win for you salvation. God calls <line>for</line> your willing obedience. He asks <line>you</line> to give up your sins. “To him that <line>overcometh,”</line> Christ declares, “will <line>I</line> grant to sit with Me in My throne, <line>even</line> as I also overcame, and am set <line>down</line> with My Father in His throne.” <line>Rev.</line> 3:21.</p></div>

<p><line>There</line> are some who seem to be always <line>seeking</line> for the heavenly pearl. But <line>they</line> do not make an entire surrender <line>of</line> their wrong habits. They do not die <line>to</line> self that Christ may live in them. <line>Therefore</line> they do not find the precious <line>pearl.</line> They have not overcome unholy <line>ambition</line> and their love for worldly <line>attractions.</line> They do not take up the <line>cross</line> and follow Christ in the path <line>of</line> self-denial and sacrifice. Almost <line>Christians,</line> yet not fully Christians, <line>they</line> seem near the kingdom of heaven, <line>but</line> they cannot enter there.

<p><line>The</line> parable of the merchantman <line>seeking</line> goodly pearls has a double <line>significance:</line> it applies not only to men <line>as</line> seeking the kingdom of heaven, <line>but</line> to Christ as seeking His lost <line>inheritance.</line> Christ, the heavenly <line>merchantman</line> seeking goodly pearls, <line>saw</line> in lost humanity the pearl of <line>price.</line> In man, defiled and ruined <line>by</line> sin, He saw the possibilities of <line>redemption.</line> Hearts that have been <line>the</line> battleground of the conflict with <line>Satan,</line> and that have been rescued by <line>the</line> power of love, are more precious <line>to</line> the Redeemer than are those who <line>have</line> never fallen. God looked upon <line>humanity,</line> not as vile and worthless; <line>He</line> looked upon it in Christ, saw it as <line>it</line> might become through redeeming <line>love.</line> He collected all the riches of the <line>universe,</line> and laid them down in order <line>to</line> buy the pearl. And Jesus, having <line>found</line> it, resets it in His own diadem. <line>.</line> . “They shall be Mine, saith the Lord <line>of</line> hosts, in that day when I make up <line>My</line> jewels.” Mal. 3:17.</p></div>

<p><line>But</line> Christ as the precious pearl, <line>and</line> our privilege of possessing this <line>heavenly</line> treasure, is the theme on <line>which</line> we most need to dwell. It is <line>the</line> Holy Spirit that reveals to men <line>the</line> preciousness of the goodly pearl. <line>The</line> time of the Holy Spirit’s power <line>is</line> the time when in a special sense the <line>heavenly</line> gift is sought and found. In <line>Christ’s</line> day many heard the gospel, <line>but</line> their minds were darkened by <line>false</line> teaching, and they did not <line>recognize</line> in the humble Teacher of <line>Galilee</line> the Sent of God.

<p><line>On</line> the day of Pentecost the Spirit was <line>given.</line> Christ’s witnesses proclaimed <line>the</line> power of the risen Saviour. The <line>light</line> of heaven penetrated the darkened <line>minds</line> of those who had been deceived <line>by</line> the enemies of Christ. They now <line>saw</line> Him exalted to be “a Prince and <line>a</line> Saviour, for to give repentance to <line>Israel,</line> and forgiveness of sins.” They <line>saw</line> Him encircled with the glory <line>of</line> heaven, with infinite treasures in <line>His</line> hands to bestow upon all who <line>would</line> turn from their rebellion. As the <line>apostles</line> set forth the glory of the Only- <line>Begotten</line> of the Father, three thousand <line>souls</line> were convicted. They were made <line>to</line> see themselves as they were, sinful <line>and</line> polluted, and Christ as their friend <line>and</line> Redeemer. Christ was lifted up, <line>Christ</line> was glorified, through the power <line>of</line> the Holy Spirit resting upon men. <line>By</line> faith these believers saw Him as <line>the</line> One who had borne humiliation, <line>suffering,</line> and death that they might <line>not</line> perish but have everlasting life. <line>The</line> revelation of Christ by the Spirit <line>brought</line> to them a realizing sense of His <line>power</line> and majesty, and they stretched <line>forth</line> their hands to Him by faith, <line>saying,</line> “I believe.”</p></div>
