<p><line>Throughout</line> the parable of the sower, <line>Christ</line> represents the different results of <line>the</line> sowing as depending upon the soil. <line>In</line> every case the sower and the seed <line>are</line> the same. Thus He teaches that if <line>the</line> word of God fails of accomplishing <line>its</line> work in our hearts and lives, the <line>reason</line> is to be found in ourselves. But <line>the</line> result is not beyond our control. <line>True,</line> we cannot change ourselves; <line>but</line> the power of choice is ours, and <line>it</line> rests with us to determine what we <line>will</line> become. The wayside, the stony- <line>ground,</line> the thorny-ground hearers need <line>not</line> remain such. The Spirit of God <line>is</line> ever seeking to break the spell of <line>infatuation</line> that holds men absorbed in <line>worldly</line> things, and to awaken a desire <line>for</line> the imperishable treasure. It is by <line>resisting</line> the Spirit that men become <line>inattentive</line> to or neglectful of God’s <line>word.</line> They are themselves responsible <line>for</line> the hardness of heart that prevents <line>the</line> good seed from taking root, and <line>for</line> the evil growths that check its development.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> garden of the heart must be <line>cultivated.</line> The soil must be broken up by <line>deep</line> repentance for sin. Poisonous, <line>Satanic</line> plants must be uprooted. The <line>soil</line> once overgrown by thorns can be <line>reclaimed</line> only by diligent labor. So <line>the</line> evil tendencies of the natural heart <line>can</line> be overcome only by earnest effort <line>in</line> the name and strength of Jesus. The <line>Lord</line> bids us by His prophet, “Break <line>up</line> your fallow ground, and sow not <line>among</line> thorns.” “Sow to yourselves in <line>righteousness;</line> reap in mercy.” Jer. 4:3; <line>Hosea</line> 10:12. This work He desires to <line>accomplish</line> for us, and He asks us to <line>cooperate</line> with Him.</p></div>

<div class="commentary">

<p><line>The</line> sowers of the seed have a work <line>to</line> do in preparing hearts to receive <line>the</line> gospel. In the ministry of the word <line>there</line> is too much sermonizing, and too <line>little</line> of real heart-to-heart work. There <line>is</line> need of personal labor for the souls <line>of</line> the lost. In Christlike sympathy we <line>should</line> come close to men individually, <line>and</line> seek to awaken their interest in the <line>great</line> things of eternal life. Their hearts <line>may</line> be as hard as the beaten highway, <line>and</line> apparently it may be a useless <line>effort</line> to present the Saviour to them; <line>but</line> while logic may fail to move, and <line>argument</line> be powerless to convince, <line>the</line> love of Christ, revealed in personal <line>ministry,</line> may soften the stony heart, so <line>that</line> the seed of truth can take root.</p></div>

<p><line>So</line> the sowers have something to do that <line>the</line> seed may not be choked with thorns <line>or</line> perish because of shallowness of <line>soil.</line> At the very outset of the Christian <line>life</line> every believer should be taught its <line>foundation</line> principles. He should be <line>taught</line> that he is not merely to be saved <line>by</line> Christ’s sacrifice, but that he is to <line>make</line> the life of Christ his life and the <line>character</line> of Christ his character. Let all <line>be</line> taught that they are to bear burdens <line>and</line> to deny natural inclination. Let <line>them</line> learn the blessedness of working <line>for</line> Christ, following Him in self-denial, <line>and</line> enduring hardness as good soldiers. <line>Let</line> them learn to trust His love and to <line>cast</line> on Him their cares. Let them taste <line>the</line> joy of winning souls for Him. In <line>their</line> love and interest for the lost, they <line>will</line> lose sight of self. The pleasures of <line>the</line> world will lose their power to attract <line>and</line> its burdens to dishearten. The <line>plowshare</line> of truth will do its work. <line>It</line> will break up the fallow ground. It <line>will</line> not merely cut off the tops of the <line>thorns,</line> but will take them out by the roots.</p></div>

<div class="commentary">

<p><line>The</line> “honest and good heart” of <line>which</line> the parable speaks, is not a <line>heart</line> without sin; for the gospel is to <line>be</line> preached to the lost. Christ said, <line>“I</line> came not to call the righteous, <line>but</line> sinners to repentance.” He has <line>an</line> honest heart who yields to the <line>conviction</line> of the Holy Spirit. He <line>confesses</line> his guilt, and feels his need <line>of</line> the mercy and love of God. He has <line>a</line> sincere desire to know the truth, <line>that</line> he may obey it. The good heart <line>is</line> a believing heart, one that has <line>faith</line> in the word of God. Without <line>faith</line> it is impossible to receive the <line>word.</line> “He that cometh to God must <line>believe</line> that He is, and that He is a <line>rewarder</line> of them that diligently seek <line>Him.”</line> Heb. 11:6.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> Pharisees of Christ’s day closed <line>their</line> eyes lest they should see, and their <line>ears</line> lest they should hear; therefore <line>the</line> truth could not reach their hearts. <line>They</line> were to suffer retribution for their <line>willful</line> ignorance and self-imposed <line>blindness.</line> But Christ taught His <line>disciples</line> that they were to open their <line>minds</line> to instruction, and be ready to <line>believe.</line> He pronounced a blessing upon <line>them</line> because they saw and heard with <line>eyes</line> and ears that believed.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> good-ground hearer receives the <line>word</line> “not as the word of men, but as <line>it</line> is in truth, the word of God.” Only <line>he</line> who receives the Scriptures as the <line>voice</line> of God speaking to himself is a <line>true</line> learner. He trembles at the word; <line>for</line> to him it is a living reality. He opens <line>his</line> understanding and his heart to <line>receive</line> it.
