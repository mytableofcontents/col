<p><line>In</line> ancient times it was customary <line>for</line> men to hide their treasures in <line>the</line> earth. Thefts and robberies were <line>frequent.</line> And whenever there was a <line>change</line> in the ruling power, those who <line>had</line> large possessions were liable to <line>be</line> put under heavy tribute. Moreover <line>the</line> country was in constant danger of <line>invasion</line> by marauding armies. As a <line>consequence,</line> the rich endeavored to <line>preserve</line> their wealth by concealing <line>it,</line> and the earth was looked upon as a <line>safe</line> hiding place. But often the place <line>of</line> concealment was forgotten; death <line>might</line> claim the owner, imprisonment <line>or</line> exile might separate him from his <line>treasure,</line> and the wealth he had taken <line>such</line> pains to preserve was left for <line>the</line> fortunate finder. In Christ’s day <line>it</line> was not uncommon to discover <line>in</line> neglected land old coins and <line>ornaments</line> of gold and silver.</p><p><line>A</line> man hires land to cultivate, and as <line>the</line> oxen plow the soil, buried treasure <line>is</line> unearthed. As the man discovers this <line>treasure,</line> he sees that a fortune is within <line>his</line> reach. Restoring the gold to its <line>hiding</line> place, he returns to his home and <line>sells</line> all that he has, in order to purchase <line>the</line> field containing the treasure. His <line>family</line> and his neighbors think that he <line>is</line> acting like a madman. Looking on the <line>field,</line> they see no value in the neglected <line>soil.</line> But the man knows what he is <line>doing;</line> and when he has a title to the <line>field,</line> he searches every part of it to find <line>the</line> treasure that he has secured.</p></div>

<p><line>This</line> parable illustrates the value of <line>the</line> heavenly treasure, and the effort <line>that</line> should be made to secure it. The <line>finder</line> of the treasure in the field was <line>ready</line> to part with all that he had, <line>ready</line> to put forth untiring labor, in <line>order</line> to secure the hidden riches. <line>So</line> the finder of heavenly treasure <line>will</line> count no labor too great and no <line>sacrifice</line> too dear, in order to gain the <line>treasures</line> of truth.</p><p><line>In</line> the parable the field containing <line>the</line> treasure represents the Holy <line>Scriptures.</line> And the gospel is the treasure. <line>The</line> earth itself is not so interlaced with <line>golden</line> veins and filled with precious <line>things</line> as is the word of God.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> treasures of the gospel are said to <line>be</line> hidden. By those who are wise in <line>their</line> own estimation, who are puffed <line>up</line> by the teaching of vain philosophy, <line>the</line> beauty and power and mystery <line>of</line> the plan of redemption are not <line>perceived.</line> Many have eyes, but they <line>see</line> not; they have ears, but they hear <line>not;</line> they have intellect, but they <line>discern</line> not the hidden treasure.</p><p><line>A</line> man might pass over the place <line>where</line> treasure had been concealed. <line>In</line> dire necessity he might sit down to <line>rest</line> at the foot of a tree, not knowing <line>of</line> the riches hidden at its roots. So <line>it</line> was with the Jews. As a golden <line>treasure,</line> truth had been intrusted <line>to</line> the Hebrew people. The Jewish <line>economy,</line> bearing the signature of <line>Heaven,</line> had been instituted by Christ <line>Himself.</line> In types and symbols the <line>great</line> truths of redemption were <line>veiled.</line> Yet when Christ came, the <line>Jews</line> did not recognize Him to whom <line>all</line> these symbols pointed. They had <line>the</line> word of God in their hands; but <line>the</line> traditions which had been handed <line>down</line> from generation to generation, <line>and</line> the human interpretation of the <line>Scriptures,</line> hid from them the truth as it <line>is</line> in Jesus. The spiritual import of the <line>sacred</line> writings was lost. The treasure <line>house</line> of all knowledge was open to <line>them,</line> but they knew it not.</p></div>

<p><line>God</line> does not conceal His truth from <line>men.</line> By their own course of action <line>they</line> make it obscure to themselves. <line>Christ</line> gave the Jewish people abundant <line>evidence</line> that He was the Messiah; but <line>His</line> teaching called for a decided change <line>in</line> their lives. They saw that if they <line>received</line> Christ, they must give up their <line>cherished</line> maxims and traditions, their <line>selfish,</line> ungodly practices. It required a <line>sacrifice</line> to receive changeless, eternal <line>truth.</line> Therefore they would not admit <line>the</line> most conclusive evidence that God <line>could</line> give to establish faith in Christ. <line>They</line> professed to believe the Old <line>Testament</line> Scriptures, yet they refused <line>to</line> accept the testimony contained <line>therein</line> concerning Christ’s life and <line>character.</line> They were afraid of being <line>convinced</line> lest they should be converted <line>and</line> be compelled to give up their <line>preconceived</line> opinions. The treasure <line>of</line> the gospel, the Way, the Truth, and <line>the</line> Life, was among them, but they <line>rejected</line> the greatest gift that Heaven <line>could</line> bestow.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> Saviour saw that men were absorbed <line>in</line> getting gain, and were losing sight <line>of</line> eternal realities. He undertook to <line>correct</line> this evil. He sought to break the <line>infatuating</line> spell that was paralyzing <line>the</line> soul. Lifting up His voice He cried, <line>“What</line> is a man profited, if he shall gain <line>the</line> whole world, and lose his own soul? <line>or</line> what shall a man give in exchange <line>for</line> his soul?” He presents before fallen <line>humanity</line> the nobler world they have <line>lost</line> sight of, that they may behold <line>eternal</line> realities. He takes them to the <line>threshold</line> of the Infinite, flushed with <line>the</line> indescribable glory of God, and <line>shows</line> them the treasure there.</p></div>

He charged <line>them</line> with the guilt of “teaching for <line>doctrines</line> the commandments of men.” <line>Mark</line> 7:7. Though they were the teachers <line>of</line> the oracles of God, though they were <line>supposed</line> to understand His word, they <line>were</line> not doers of the word. Satan had <line>blinded</line> their eyes that they should not <line>see</line> its true import.</p><p><line>This</line> is the work of many in our day. <line>Many</line> churches are guilty of this sin. <line>There</line> is danger, great danger, that the <line>supposed</line> wise men of today will repeat <line>the</line> experience of the Jewish teachers. <line>They</line> falsely interpret the divine oracles, <line>and</line> souls are brought into perplexity <line>and</line> shrouded in darkness because of <line>their</line> misconception of divine truth.</p></div>
