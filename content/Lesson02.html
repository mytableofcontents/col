<p><line>That</line> with which the parable of the sower <line>chiefly</line> deals is the effect produced on <line>the</line> growth of the seed by the soil into <line>which</line> it is cast. By this parable Christ <line>was</line> virtually saying to His hearers, It <line>is</line> not safe for you to stand as critics of <line>My</line> work, or to indulge disappointment <line>because</line> it does not meet your ideas. <line>The</line> question of greatest importance to <line>you</line> is, How do you treat My message? <line>Upon</line> your reception or rejection of it <line>your</line> eternal destiny depends.</p></div>

<p><line>Explaining</line> the seed that fell by the <line>wayside,</line> He said, “When any one <line>heareth</line> the word of the kingdom, and <line>understandeth</line> it not, then cometh the <line>wicked</line> one, and catcheth away that <line>which</line> was sown in his heart. This is he <line>which</line> received seed by the wayside.”</p><p><line>The</line> seed sown by the wayside <line>represents</line> the word of God as it falls <line>upon</line> the heart of an inattentive hearer. <line>Like</line> the hard-beaten path, trodden <line>down</line> by the feet of men and beasts, <line>is</line> the heart that becomes a highway <line>for</line> the world’s traffic, its pleasures <line>and</line> sins. Absorbed in selfish aims <line>and</line> sinful indulgences, the soul is <line>“hardened</line> through the deceitfulness of <line>sin.”</line> Heb. 3:13. The spiritual faculties <line>are</line> paralyzed. Men hear the word, but <line>understand</line> it not. They do not discern <line>that</line> it applies to themselves. They do <line>not</line> realize their need or their danger. <line>They</line> do not perceive the love of <line>Christ,</line> and they pass by the message <line>of</line> His grace as something that does not <line>concern</line> them.</p></div>

<p><line>As</line> the birds are ready to catch up <line>the</line> seed from the wayside, so Satan <line>is</line> ready to catch away the seeds of <line>divine</line> truth from the soul. He fears <line>that</line> the word of God may awaken <line>the</line> careless, and take effect upon the <line>hardened</line> heart. Satan and his angels <line>are</line> in the assemblies where the gospel <line>is</line> preached. While angels of heaven <line>endeavor</line> to impress hearts with the <line>word</line> of God, the enemy is on the alert <line>to</line> make the word of no effect. With an <line>earnestness</line> equaled only by his malice, <line>he</line> tries to thwart the work of the Spirit <line>of</line> God. While Christ is drawing the <line>soul</line> by His love, Satan tries to turn <line>away</line> the attention of the one who is <line>moved</line> to seek the Saviour. He engages <line>the</line> mind with worldly schemes. He <line>excites</line> criticism, or insinuates doubt <line>and</line> unbelief. The speaker’s choice of <line>language</line> or his manner may not please <line>the</line> hearers, and they dwell upon these <line>defects.</line> Thus the truth they need, and <line>which</line> God has graciously sent them, <line>makes</line> no lasting impression.</p></div>

<p><line>Satan</line> has many helpers. Many who <line>profess</line> to be Christians are aiding the <line>tempter</line> to catch away the seeds of truth <line>from</line> other hearts. Many who listen to <line>the</line> preaching of the word of God make <line>it</line> the subject of criticism at home. They <line>sit</line> in judgment on the sermon as they <line>would</line> on the words of a lecturer or <line>a</line> political speaker. The message that <line>should</line> be regarded as the word of the <line>Lord</line> to them is dwelt upon with trifling <line>or</line> sarcastic comment. The minister’s <line>character,</line> motives, and actions, and <line>the</line> conduct of fellow members of the <line>church,</line> are freely discussed. Severe <line>judgment</line> is pronounced, gossip or <line>slander</line> repeated, and this in the hearing <line>of</line> the unconverted. Often these things <line>are</line> spoken by parents in the hearing of <line>their</line> own children. Thus are destroyed <line>respect</line> for God’s messengers, and <line>reverence</line> for their message. And <line>many</line> are taught to regard lightly <line>God’s</line> word itself.</p><p><line>Thus</line> in the homes of professed <line>Christians</line> many youth are educated to <line>be</line> infidels. And the parents question <line>why</line> their children are so little interested <line>in</line> the gospel, and so ready to doubt the <line>truth</line> of the Bible. They wonder that <line>it</line> is so difficult to reach them with <line>moral</line> and religious influences. They <line>do</line> not see that their own example has <line>hardened</line> the hearts of their children. <line>The</line> good seed finds no place to take <line>root,</line> and Satan catches it away.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> seed sown upon stony ground finds <line>little</line> depth of soil. The plant springs up <line>quickly,</line> but the root cannot penetrate <line>the</line> rock to find nutriment to sustain <line>its</line> growth, and it soon perishes. Many <line>who</line> make a profession of religion <line>are</line> stony-ground hearers. Like the <line>rock</line> underlying the layer of earth, <line>the</line> selfishness of the natural heart <line>underlies</line> the soil of their good desires <line>and</line> aspirations. The love of self is <line>not</line> subdued. They have not seen the <line>exceeding</line> sinfulness of sin, and the <line>heart</line> has not been humbled under a <line>sense</line> of its guilt. This class may be <line>easily</line> convinced, and appear to be <line>bright</line> converts, but they have only a <line>superficial</line> religion.</p></div>

<p><line>It</line> is not because men receive the word <line>immediately,</line> nor because they rejoice <line>in</line> it, that they fall away. As soon as <line>Matthew</line> heard the Saviour’s call, <line>immediately</line> he rose up, left all, and <line>followed</line> Him. As soon as the divine <line>word</line> comes to our hearts, God desires <line>us</line> to receive it; and it is right to accept it <line>with</line> joy. “Joy shall be in heaven over <line>one</line> sinner that repenteth.” Luke 15:7. <line>And</line> there is joy in the soul that <line>believes</line> on Christ. But those who in <line>the</line> parable are said to receive the word <line>immediately,</line> do not count the cost. <line>They</line> do not consider what the word <line>of</line> God requires of them. They do not <line>bring</line> it face to face with all their habits <line>of</line> life, and yield themselves fully to <line>its</line> control.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> roots of the plant strike down deep <line>into</line> the soil, and hidden from sight <line>nourish</line> the life of the plant. So with <line>the</line> Christian; it is by the invisible union <line>of</line> the soul with Christ, through faith, <line>that</line> the spiritual life is nourished. But <line>the</line> stony-ground hearers depend upon <line>self</line> instead of Christ. They trust in their <line>good</line> works and good impulses, and <line>are</line> strong in their own righteousness. <line>They</line> are not strong in the Lord, and <line>in</line> the power of His might.

<p><line>The</line> hot summer sun, that strengthens <line>and</line> ripens the hardy grain, destroys <line>that</line> which has no depth of root. So he <line>who</line> “hath not root in himself,” “dureth <line>for</line> a while”; but “when tribulation or <line>persecution</line> ariseth because of the word, <line>by</line> and by he is offended.” Many receive <line>the</line> gospel as a way of escape from <line>suffering,</line> rather than as a deliverance <line>from</line> sin. They rejoice for a season, <line>for</line> they think that religion will free <line>them</line> from difficulty and trial. While <line>life</line> moves smoothly with them, they <line>may</line> appear to be consistent Christians. <line>But</line> they faint beneath the fiery test of <line>temptation.</line> They cannot bear reproach <line>for</line> Christ’s sake. When the word of <line>God</line> points out some cherished sin, or <line>requires</line> self-denial or sacrifice, they <line>are</line> offended. It would cost them too <line>much</line> effort to make a radical change in <line>their</line> life. They look at the present <line>inconvenience</line> and trial, and forget the <line>eternal</line> realities. Like the disciples who <line>left</line> Jesus, they are ready to say, “This <line>is</line> an hard saying; who can hear it?” <line>John</line> 6:60.</p></div>

<p><line>There</line> are very many who claim to serve <line>God,</line> but who have no experimental <line>knowledge</line> of Him. Their desire <line>to</line> do His will is based upon their <line>own</line> inclination, not upon the deep <line>conviction</line> of the Holy Spirit.

<p><line>It</line> is one thing to assent in a general <line>way</line> to the agency of the Holy Spirit, <line>and</line> another thing to accept His work as <line>a</line> reprover calling to repentance. Many <line>feel</line> a sense of estrangement from God, <line>a</line> realization of their bondage to self and <line>sin;</line> they make efforts for reform; but <line>they</line> do not crucify self. They do not <line>give</line> themselves entirely into the hands <line>of</line> Christ, seeking for divine power to <line>do</line> His will. They are not willing to be <line>molded</line> after the divine similitude. In <line>a</line> general way they acknowledge their <line>imperfections,</line> but they do not give up <line>their</line> particular sins. With each wrong <line>act</line> the old selfish nature is gaining strength.</p><p><line>The</line> only hope for these souls is to <line>realize</line> in themselves the truth of <line>Christ’s</line> words to Nicodemus, “Ye must <line>be</line> born again.” “Except a man be born <line>from</line> above, he can not see the kingdom <line>of</line> God.” John 3:7, 3.</p></div>
