<p><line>While</line> Christ was teaching the people, <line>He</line> was also educating His disciples for <line>their</line> future work. In all His instruction <line>there</line> were lessons for them. After <line>giving</line> the parable of the net, He asked <line>them,</line> “Have ye understood all these <line>things?”</line> They said unto Him, “Yea, <line>Lord.”</line> Then in another parable He <line>set</line> before them their responsibility in <line>regard</line> to the truths they had received. <line>“Therefore,”</line> He said, “every scribe <line>which</line> is instructed unto the kingdom <line>of</line> heaven is like unto a man that is an <line>house-holder,</line> which bringeth forth out <line>of</line> his treasure things new and old.”</p><p><line>The</line> treasure gained by the house- <line>holder</line> he does not hoard. He brings it <line>forth</line> to communicate to others. And <line>by</line> use the treasure increases. The <line>householder</line> has precious things both <line>new</line> and old. So Christ teaches that <line>the</line> truth committed to His disciples is <line>to</line> be communicated to the world. And <line>as</line> the knowledge of truth is imparted, <line>it</line> will increase.</p></div>

<p><line>All</line> who receive the gospel message <line>into</line> the heart will long to proclaim it. <line>The</line> heaven-born love of Christ must <line>find</line> expression. Those who have put <line>on</line> Christ will relate their experience, <line>tracing</line> step by step the leadings of <line>the</line> Holy Spirit–their hungering and <line>thirsting</line> for the knowledge of God <line>and</line> of Jesus Christ whom He has <line>sent,</line> the results of their searching <line>of</line> the Scriptures, their prayers, their <line>soul</line> agony, and the words of Christ <line>to</line> them, “Thy sins be forgiven thee.” <line>It</line> is unnatural for any to keep these <line>things</line> secret, and those who are filled <line>with</line> the love of Christ will not do so. <line>In</line> proportion as the Lord has made <line>them</line> the depositaries of sacred truth <line>will</line> be their desire that others shall <line>receive</line> the same blessing. And as <line>they</line> make known the rich treasures <line>of</line> God’s grace, more and still more <line>of</line> the grace of Christ will be imparted <line>to</line> them. They will have the heart <line>of</line> a little child in its simplicity and <line>unreserved</line> obedience. Their souls <line>will</line> pant after holiness, and more and <line>more</line> of the treasures of truth and grace <line>will</line> be revealed to them to be given <line>to</line> the world.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> great storehouse of truth is the word <line>of</line> God–the written word, the book of <line>nature,</line> and the book of experience in <line>God’s</line> dealing with human life. Here are <line>the</line> treasures from which Christ’s workers <line>are</line> to draw. In the search after truth they <line>are</line> to depend upon God, not upon human <line>intelligences,</line> the great men whose wisdom <line>is</line> foolishness with God. Through His own <line>appointed</line> channels the Lord will impart a <line>knowledge</line> of Himself to every seeker.</p></div>

<p><line>If</line> the follower of Christ will believe <line>His</line> word and practice it, there is <line>no</line> science in the natural world that <line>he</line> will not be able to grasp and <line>appreciate.</line> There is nothing but that <line>will</line> furnish him means for imparting <line>the</line> truth to others. Natural science is <line>a</line> treasure house of knowledge from <line>which</line> every student in the school of <line>Christ</line> may draw. As we contemplate <line>the</line> beauty of nature, as we study its <line>lessons</line> in the cultivation of the soil, <line>in</line> the growth of the trees, in all the <line>wonders</line> of earth and sea and sky, <line>there</line> will come to us a new perception <line>of</line> truth. And the mysteries connected <line>with</line> God’s dealings with men, the <line>depths</line> of His wisdom and judgment as <line>seen</line> in human life–these are found to <line>be</line> a storehouse rich in treasure.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> word of God includes the Scrip- <line>tures</line> of the Old Testament as well <line>as</line> of the New. One is not complete <line>without</line> the other. Christ declared <line>that</line> the truths of the Old Testament <line>are</line> as valuable as those of the New. <line>Christ</line> was as much man’s Redeemer <line>in</line> the beginning of the world as He is <line>today.</line> Before He clothed His divin- <line>ity</line> with humanity and came to our <line>world,</line> the gospel message was given <line>by</line> Adam, Seth, Enoch, Methuselah, <line>and</line> Noah. Abraham in Canaan and <line>Lot</line> in Sodom bore the message, and <line>from</line> generation to generation faithful <line>messengers</line> proclaimed the Coming <line>One.</line> The rites of the Jewish economy <line>were</line> instituted by Christ Himself. He <line>was</line> the foundation of their system of <line>sacrificial</line> offerings, the great antitype <line>of</line> all their religious service. The blood <line>shed</line> as the sacrifices were offered <line>pointed</line> to the sacrifice of the Lamb <line>of</line> God. All the typical offerings were <line>fulfilled</line> in Him.</p><p><line>Christ</line> as manifested to the patriarchs, <line>as</line> symbolized in the sacrificial service, <line>as</line> portrayed in the law, and as revealed <line>by</line> the prophets, is the riches of the <line>Old</line> Testament. Christ in His life, His <line>death,</line> and His resurrection, Christ as <line>He</line> is manifested by the Holy Spirit, is <line>the</line> treasure of the New Testament. Our <line>Saviour,</line> the outshining of the Father’s <line>glory,</line> is both the Old and the New.</p></div>

<p><line>Of</line> Christ’s life and death and interces- <line>sion,</line> which prophets had foretold, the <line>apostles</line> were to go forth as witnesses. <line>Christ</line> in His humiliation, in His purity <line>and</line> holiness, in His matchless love, <line>was</line> to be their theme.

<p><line>Christ</line> in His teaching presented old <line>truths</line> of which He Himself was the <line>originator,</line> truths which He had spoken <line>through</line> patriarchs and prophets; but <line>He</line> now shed upon them a new light. <line>How</line> different appeared their meaning! <line>A</line> flood of light and spirituality was <line>brought</line> in by His explanation. And He <line>promised</line> that the Holy Spirit should <line>enlighten</line> the disciples, that the word of <line>God</line> should be ever unfolding to them. <line>They</line> would be able to present its truths <line>in</line> new beauty.</p><p><line>Ever</line> since the first promise of redemp- <line>tion</line> was spoken in Eden, the life, the <line>character,</line> and the mediatorial work <line>of</line> Christ have been the study of hu- <line>man</line> minds. Yet every mind through <line>whom</line> the Holy Spirit has worked has <line>presented</line> these themes in a light that is <line>fresh</line> and new. The truths of redemption <line>are</line> capable of constant development <line>and</line> expansion. Though old, they are <line>ever</line> new, constantly revealing to the <line>seeker</line> for truth a greater glory and a <line>mightier</line> power.</p><p><line>In</line> every age there is a new development <line>of</line> truth, a message of God to the people <line>of</line> that generation. The old truths are all <line>essential;</line> new truth is not independent <line>of</line> the old, but an unfolding of it. It is <line>only</line> as the old truths are understood <line>that</line> we can comprehend the new. When <line>Christ</line> desired to open to His disciples <line>the</line> truth of His resurrection, He <line>began</line> “at Moses and all the prophets” <line>and</line> “expounded unto them in all <line>the</line> scriptures the things concerning <line>Himself.”</line> Luke 24:27.</p></div>

<p><line>There</line> are those who profess to believe <line>and</line> to teach the truths of the Old <line>Testament,</line> while they reject the New. <line>But</line> in refusing to receive the teachings <line>of</line> Christ, they show that they do not <line>believe</line> that which patriarchs and <line>prophets</line> have spoken. “Had ye believed <line>Moses,”</line> Christ said, “ye would have <line>believed</line> Me; for he wrote of Me.” <line>Hence</line> there is no real power in their <line>teaching</line> of even the Old Testament. <line>Many</line> who claim to believe and to teach <line>the</line> gospel are in a similar error. They <line>set</line> aside the Old Testament Scriptures, <line>of</line> which Christ declared, “They are <line>they</line> which testify of Me.” John 5:39.</p><p><line>In</line> rejecting the Old, they virtually <line>reject</line> the New; for both are parts of <line>an</line> inseparable whole. No man can <line>rightly</line> present the law of God without <line>the</line> gospel, or the gospel without the <line>law.</line> The law is the gospel embodied, <line>and</line> the gospel is the law unfolded. The <line>law</line> is the root, the gospel is the fragrant <line>blossom</line> and fruit which it bears. <line>The</line> Old Testament sheds light upon <line>the</line> New, and the New upon the Old. <line>Each</line> is a revelation of the glory of <line>God</line> in Christ. Both present truths that <line>will</line> continually reveal new depths of <line>meaning</line> to the earnest seeker.</p></div>

<p><line>In</line> those who possess it, the religion of <line>Christ</line> will reveal itself as a vitalizing, <line>pervading</line> principle, a living, working, <line>spiritual</line> energy.

<p><line>As</line> the life of Christ and the character <line>of</line> His mission are dwelt upon, rays of <line>light</line> will shine forth more distinctly at <line>every</line> attempt to discover truth. Each <line>fresh</line> search will reveal something more <line>deeply</line> interesting than has yet been <line>unfolded.</line> The subject is inexhaustible. <line>The</line> study of the incarnation of Christ, <line>His</line> atoning sacrifice and mediatorial <line>work,</line> will employ the mind of the <line>diligent</line> student as long as time shall <line>last;</line> and looking to heaven with its <line>unnumbered</line> years he will exclaim, <line>“Great</line> is the mystery of godliness.” <line>In</line> eternity we shall learn that which, <line>had</line> we received the enlightenment it <line>was</line> possible to obtain here, would have <line>opened</line> our understanding. The themes <line>of</line> redemption will employ the hearts <line>and</line> minds and tongues of the redeemed <line>through</line> the everlasting ages. They will <line>understand</line> the truths which Christ <line>longed</line> to open to His disciples, but <line>which</line> they did not have faith to grasp. <line>Forever</line> and forever new views of the <line>perfection</line> and glory of Christ will <line>appear.</line> Through endless ages will the <line>faithful</line> Householder bring forth from <line>His</line> treasure things new and old.</p></div>
