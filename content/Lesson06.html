</div>
<hr/><p class="note">“Another parable put He forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field; but while men  slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.”</p>

<p><line>In</line> the East, men sometimes took <line>revenge</line> upon an enemy by strewing <line>his</line> newly sown fields with the seeds <line>of</line> some noxious weed that, while <line>growing,</line> closely resembled wheat. <line>Springing</line> up with the wheat, it injured <line>the</line> crop and brought trouble and loss <line>to</line> the owner of the field. So it is from <line>enmity</line> to Christ that Satan scatters <line>his</line> evil seed among the good grain of <line>the</line> kingdom. The fruit of his sowing <line>he</line> attributes to the Son of God. By <line>bringing</line> into the church those who <line>bear</line> Christ’s name while they deny <line>His</line> character, the wicked one causes <line>that</line> God shall be dishonored, the work <line>of</line> salvation misrepresented, and souls imperiled.</p></div>

<p><line>Christ</line> has plainly taught that those <line>who</line> persist in open sin must be <line>separated</line> from the church, but He <line>has</line> not committed to us the work <line>of</line> judging character and motive. <line>He</line> knows our nature too well to <line>entrust</line> this work to us. Should we <line>try</line> to uproot from the church those <line>whom</line> we suppose to be spurious <line>Christians,</line> we should be sure to make <line>mistakes.</line> Often we regard as hopeless <line>subjects</line> the very ones whom Christ <line>is</line> drawing to Himself.

Many who <line>think</line> themselves Christians will at <line>last</line> be found wanting. Many will <line>be</line> in heaven who their neighbors <line>supposed</line> would never enter there. <line>Man</line> judges from appearance, but <line>God</line> judges the heart. The tares and <line>the</line> wheat are to grow together until <line>the</line> harvest; and the harvest is the end <line>of</line> probationary time.</p></div>

<p><line>There</line> is in the Saviour’s words another <line>lesson,</line> a lesson of wonderful for- <line>bearance</line> and tender love. As the tares <line>have</line> their roots closely intertwined <line>with</line> those of the good grain, so false <line>brethren</line> in the church may be closely <line>linked</line> with true disciples. The real <line>character</line> of these pretended believers <line>is</line> not fully manifested. Were they to be <line>separated</line> from the church, others might <line>be</line> caused to stumble, who but for this <line>would</line> have remained steadfast.</p><p><line>The</line> teaching of this parable is illustrated <line>in</line> God’s own dealing with men and <line>angels.</line> Satan is a deceiver. When he <line>sinned</line> in heaven, even the loyal angels <line>did</line> not fully discern his character. This <line>was</line> why God did not at once destroy <line>Satan.</line> Had He done so, the holy angels <line>would</line> not have perceived the justice <line>and</line> love of God. A doubt of God’s <line>goodness</line> would have been as evil <line>seed</line> that would yield the bitter fruit of <line>sin</line> and woe. Therefore the author of <line>evil</line> was spared, fully to develop his character.</p><p><line>Through</line> long ages God has borne the <line>anguish</line> of beholding the work of evil, <line>He</line> has given the infinite Gift of Calvary, <line>rather</line> than leave any to be deceived by <line>the</line> misrepresentations of the wicked <line>one;</line> for the tares could not be plucked up <line>without</line> danger of uprooting the precious <line>grain.</line> And shall we not be as forbearing <line>toward</line> our fellow men as the Lord of <line>heaven</line> and earth is toward Satan?</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> world has no right to doubt the <line>truth</line> of Christianity because there are <line>unworthy</line> members in the church, nor <line>should</line> Christians become disheartened <line>because</line> of these false brethren. How <line>was</line> it with the early church? Ananias <line>and</line> Sapphira joined themselves to the <line>disciples.</line> Simon Magus was baptized. <line>Demas,</line> who forsook Paul, had been <line>counted</line> a believer. Judas Iscariot <line>was</line> numbered with the apostles. The <line>Redeemer</line> does not want to lose one <line>soul;</line> His experience with Judas is <line>recorded</line> to show His long patience with <line>perverse</line> human nature; and He bids us <line>bear</line> with it as He has borne. He has said <line>that</line> false brethren will be found in the <line>church</line> till the close of time.</p><p><line>Notwithstanding</line> Christ’s warning, men <line>have</line> sought to uproot the tares. To <line>punish</line> those who were supposed to be <line>evildoers,</line> the church has had recourse <line>to</line> the civil power. Those who differed <line>from</line> the established doctrines have <line>been</line> imprisoned, put to torture and <line>to</line> death, at the instigation of men <line>who</line> claimed to be acting under the <line>sanction</line> of Christ. But it is the spirit <line>of</line> Satan, not the Spirit of Christ, that <line>inspires</line> such acts. This is Satan’s <line>own</line> method of bringing the world <line>under</line> his dominion. God has been <line>misrepresented</line> through the church <line>by</line> this way of dealing with those <line>supposed</line> to be heretics.</p><p><line>Not</line> judgment and condemnation of <line>others,</line> but humility and distrust of self, <line>is</line> the teaching of Christ’s parable. Not <line>all</line> that is sown in the field is good grain. <line>The</line> fact that men are in the church does <line>not</line> prove them Christians.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> tares closely resembled the wheat <line>while</line> the blades were green; but when <line>the</line> field was white for the harvest, the <line>worthless</line> weeds bore no likeness to the <line>wheat</line> that bowed under the weight of <line>its</line> full, ripe heads.
