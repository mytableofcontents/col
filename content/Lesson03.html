<p><line>Grace</line> can thrive only in the heart that <line>is</line> being constantly prepared for the <line>precious</line> seeds of truth. The thorns of <line>sin</line> will grow in any soil; they need no <line>cultivation;</line> but grace must be carefully <line>cultivated.</line> The briers and thorns are <line>always</line> ready to spring up, and the <line>work</line> of purification must advance <line>continually.</line> If the heart is not kept <line>under</line> the control of God, if the Holy <line>Spirit</line> does not work unceasingly to <line>refine</line> and ennoble the character, the old <line>habits</line> will reveal themselves in the life. <line>Men</line> may profess to believe the gospel; <line>but</line> unless they are sanctified by the <line>gospel</line> their profession is of no avail. <line>If</line> they do not gain the victory over <line>sin,</line> then sin is gaining the victory over <line>them.</line> The thorns that have been cut off <line>but</line> not uprooted grow apace, until the <line>soul</line> is overspread with them.</p></div>

<p><line>Christ</line> specified the things that are <line>dangerous</line> to the soul. As recorded <line>by</line> Mark He mentions the cares <line>of</line> this world, the deceitfulness of <line>riches,</line> and the lusts of other things. <line>Luke</line> specifies the cares, riches, <line>and</line> pleasures of this life. These are <line>what</line> choke the word, the growing <line>spiritual</line> seed.

<p><line>“The</line> cares of this world.” No class is free <line>from</line> the temptation to worldly care. To the <line>poor,</line> toil and deprivation and the fear of <line>want</line> bring perplexities and burdens. To the <line>rich</line> come fear of loss and a multitude of <line>anxious</line> cares. Many of Christ’s followers <line>forget</line> the lesson He has bidden us learn <line>from</line> the flowers of the field. They do not <line>trust</line> to His constant care. Christ cannot <line>carry</line> their burden, because they do not cast <line>it</line> upon Him. Therefore the cares of life, <line>which</line> should drive them to the Saviour <line>for</line> help and comfort, separate them <line>from</line> Him.</p></div>

<p><line>Many</line> who might be fruitful in God’s <line>service</line> become bent on acquiring <line>wealth.</line> Their whole energy is absorbed <line>in</line> business enterprises, and they feel <line>obliged</line> to neglect things of a spiritual <line>nature.</line> Thus they separate themselves <line>from</line> God. We are enjoined in the <line>Scriptures</line> to be “not slothful in <line>business.”</line> Rom. 12:11. We are to <line>labor</line> that we may impart to him who <line>needs.</line> Christians must work, they <line>must</line> engage in business, and they can <line>do</line> this without committing sin. But <line>many</line> become so absorbed in business <line>that</line> they have no time for prayer, no <line>time</line> for the study of the Bible, no time <line>to</line> seek and serve God. At times the <line>longings</line> of the soul go out for holiness <line>and</line> heaven; but there is no time to <line>turn</line> aside from the din of the world to <line>listen</line> to the majestic and authoritative <line>utterances</line> of the Spirit of God. The <line>things</line> of eternity are made subordinate, <line>the</line> things of the world supreme.

<p><line>“The</line> deceitfulness of riches.” The love <line>of</line> riches has an infatuating, deceptive <line>power.</line> Too often those who possess <line>worldly</line> treasure forget that it is God <line>who</line> gives them power to get wealth. <line>They</line> say, “My power and the might of <line>mine</line> hand hath gotten me this wealth.” <line>Deut.</line> 8:17. Their riches, instead of <line>awakening</line> gratitude to God, lead to the <line>exaltation</line> of self. They lose the sense <line>of</line> their dependence upon God and their <line>obligation</line> to their fellow men. Instead <line>of</line> regarding wealth as a talent to be <line>employed</line> for the glory of God and the <line>uplifting</line> of humanity, they look upon <line>it</line> as a means of serving themselves. <line>Instead</line> of developing in man the <line>attributes</line> of God, riches thus used are <line>developing</line> in him the attributes of <line>Satan.</line> The seed of the word is choked <line>with</line> thorns.</p></div>

<p><line>When</line> the mind is youthful and vigorous <line>and</line> susceptible of rapid development, <line>there</line> is great temptation to be ambitious <line>for</line> self, to serve self.

When <line>circumstances</line> favor this development, <line>growth</line> will be seen in a direction <line>prohibited</line> by the word of God.</p><p><line>In</line> this formative period of their <line>children’s</line> life, the responsibility of <line>parents</line> is very great. It should be <line>their</line> study to surround the youth with <line>right</line> influences, influences that will <line>give</line> them correct views of life and <line>its</line> true success. Instead of this, how <line>many</line> parents make it their first object <line>to</line> secure for their children worldly <line>prosperity.</line> All their associations are <line>chosen</line> with reference to this object. <line>Many</line> parents make their home in <line>some</line> large city, and introduce their <line>children</line> into fashionable society.

<p><line>The</line> pursuit of pleasure and amusement <line>centers</line> in the cities. Many parents <line>who</line> choose a city home for their <line>children,</line> thinking to give them greater <line>advantages,</line> meet with disappointment, <line>and</line> too late repent their terrible mistake. <line>The</line> cities of today are fast becoming <line>like</line> Sodom and Gomorrah. The many <line>holidays</line> encourage idleness. The <line>exciting</line> sports–theatergoing, horse <line>racing,</line> gambling, liquor-drinking, and <line>reveling–stimulate</line> every passion to <line>intense</line> activity. The youth are swept <line>away</line> by the popular current. Those <line>who</line> learn to love amusement for its <line>own</line> sake open the door to a flood of <line>temptations.</line> They give themselves up <line>to</line> social gaiety and thoughtless mirth, <line>and</line> their intercourse with pleasure <line>lovers</line> has an intoxicating effect upon <line>the</line> mind. They are led on from one <line>form</line> of dissipation to another, until <line>they</line> lose both the desire and the <line>capacity</line> for a life of usefulness. Their <line>religious</line> aspirations are chilled; their <line>spiritual</line> life is darkened. All the nobler <line>faculties</line> of the soul, all that link man <line>with</line> the spiritual world, are debased.</p><p><line>It</line> is true that some may see their folly <line>and</line> repent. God may pardon them. But <line>they</line> have wounded their own souls, <line>and</line> brought upon themselves a lifelong <line>peril.</line> The power of discernment, which <line>ought</line> ever to be kept keen and sensitive <line>to</line> distinguish between right and wrong, <line>is</line> in a great measure destroyed. They <line>are</line> not quick to recognize the guiding <line>voice</line> of the Holy Spirit, or to discern <line>the</line> devices of Satan. Too often in time <line>of</line> danger they fall under temptation, <line>and</line> are led away from God. The end of <line>their</line> pleasure-loving life is ruin for this <line>world</line> and for the world to come.</p></div>

<p><line>Cares,</line> riches, pleasures, all are used <line>by</line> Satan in playing the game of life <line>for</line> the human soul. The warning is <line>given,</line> “Love not the world, neither the <line>things</line> that are in the world. If any man <line>love</line> the world, the love of the Father is <line>not</line> in him. For all that is in the world, <line>the</line> lust of the flesh, and the lust of the <line>eyes,</line> and the pride of life, is not of the <line>Father,</line> but is of the world.” 1 John <line>2:15,</line> 16. He who reads the hearts of <line>men</line> as an open book says, “Take heed <line>to</line> yourselves, lest at any time your <line>hearts</line> be overcharged with surfeiting <line>and</line> drunkenness and cares of this life.” <line>Luke</line> 21:34. And the apostle Paul by <line>the</line> Holy Spirit writes, “They that <line>will</line> be rich fall into temptation and <line>a</line> snare, and into many foolish and <line>hurtful</line> lusts, which drown men in <line>destruction</line> and perdition. For the <line>love</line> of money is the root of all evil; <line>which,</line> while some coveted after, <line>they</line> have erred from the faith, and <line>pierced</line> themselves through with <line>many</line> sorrows.”</p></div>
