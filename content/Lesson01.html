<p><line>By</line> the parable of the sower, Christ <line>illustrates</line> the things of the kingdom <line>of</line> heaven, and the work of the great <line>Husbandman</line> for His people. Like a <line>sower</line> in the field, He came to scatter the <line>heavenly</line> grain of truth. And His parable <line>teaching</line> itself was the seed with which <line>the</line> most precious truths of His grace <line>were</line> sown. Because of its simplicity <line>the</line> parable of the sower has not been <line>valued</line> as it should be. From the natural <line>seed</line> cast into the soil, Christ desires to <line>lead</line> our minds to the gospel seed, the <line>sowing</line> of which results in bringing <line>man</line> back to his loyalty to God. He <line>who</line> gave the parable of the tiny seed is <line>the</line> Sovereign of heaven, and the same <line>laws</line> that govern earthly seed sowing <line>govern</line> the sowing of the seeds of truth.</p></div>

<p><line>By</line> the Sea of Galilee a company had <line>gathered</line> to see and hear Jesus–an eager, <line>expectant</line> throng. The sick were there, <line>lying</line> on their mats, waiting to present <line>their</line> cases before Him. It was Christ’s <line>God-given</line> right to heal the woes of <line>a</line> sinful race, and He now rebuked <line>disease,</line> and diffused around Him life <line>and</line> health and peace.</p><p><line>As</line> the crowd continued to increase, <line>the</line> people pressed close about Christ <line>until</line> there was no room to receive <line>them.</line> Then, speaking a word to the <line>men</line> in their fishing boats, He stepped <line>into</line> the boat that was waiting to take <line>Him</line> across the lake, and bidding His <line>disciples</line> push off a little from the <line>land,</line> He spoke to the multitude upon <line>the</line> shore.</p></div>

<p><line>Beside</line> the sea lay the beautiful plain of <line>Gennesaret,</line> beyond rose the hills, and <line>upon</line> hillside and plain both sowers and <line>reapers</line> were busy, the one casting seed <line>and</line> the other harvesting the early grain. <line>Looking</line> upon the scene, Christ said–</p><p><line>“Behold,</line> the sower went forth to sow; <line>and</line> as he sowed, some seeds fell by <line>the</line> wayside, and the birds came and <line>devoured</line> them” (R.V.); “some fell <line>upon</line> stony places, where they had not <line>much</line> earth; and forthwith they sprung <line>up,</line> because they had no deepness of <line>earth:</line> and when the sun was up, they <line>were</line> scorched; and because they had no <line>root,</line> they withered away.

<p><line>Christ’s</line> mission was not understood <line>by</line> the people of His time. The manner <line>of</line> His coming was not in accordance <line>with</line> their expectations. The Lord Jesus <line>was</line> the foundation of the whole Jewish <line>economy.</line> Its imposing services were <line>of</line> divine appointment. They were <line>designed</line> to teach the people that at the <line>time</line> appointed One would come to <line>whom</line> those ceremonies pointed. But <line>the</line> Jews had exalted the forms and <line>ceremonies</line> and had lost sight of their <line>object.</line> The traditions, maxims, and <line>enactments</line> of men hid from them the <line>lessons</line> which God intended to convey. <line>These</line> maxims and traditions became <line>an</line> obstacle to their understanding and <line>practice</line> of true religion. And when <line>the</line> Reality came, in the person of <line>Christ,</line> they did not recognize in Him <line>the</line> fulfillment of all their types, the <line>substance</line> of all their shadows. They <line>rejected</line> the antitype, and clung to their <line>types</line> and useless ceremonies. The Son <line>of</line> God had come, but they continued to <line>ask</line> for a sign. The message, “Repent <line>ye;</line> for the kingdom of heaven is at <line>hand,”</line> they answered by demands for <line>a</line> miracle. Matt. 3:2. The gospel of <line>Christ</line> was a stumbling block to them <line>because</line> they demanded signs instead of <line>a</line> Saviour. They expected the Messiah <line>to</line> prove His claims by mighty deeds <line>of</line> conquest, to establish His empire <line>on</line> the ruins of earthly kingdoms. <line>This</line> expectation Christ answered in <line>the</line> parable of the sower. Not by force <line>of</line> arms, not by violent interpositions, <line>was</line> the kingdom of God to prevail, but <line>by</line> the implanting of a new principle in <line>the</line> hearts of men.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> Pharisees perceived the meaning <line>of</line> Christ’s parable, but to them its <line>lesson</line> was unwelcome. They affected <line>not</line> to understand it. To the multitude <line>it</line> involved in still greater mystery the <line>purpose</line> of the new teacher, whose <line>words</line> had so strangely moved their <line>hearts</line> and so bitterly disappointed <line>their</line> ambitions. The disciples them- <line>selves</line> had not understood the parable, <line>but</line> their interest was awakened. They <line>came</line> to Jesus privately and asked for <line>an</line> explanation.</p></div>

<p><line>This</line> was the desire which Christ <line>wished</line> to arouse, that He might give <line>them</line> more definite instruction. He <line>explained</line> the parable to them, as He <line>will</line> make plain His word to all who <line>seek</line> Him in sincerity of heart. Those <line>who</line> study the word of God with hearts <line>open</line> to the enlightenment of the Holy <line>Spirit,</line> will not remain in darkness as to <line>the</line> meaning of the word. “If any man <line>willeth</line> to do His will,” Christ said, “he <line>shall</line> know of the teaching whether it <line>be</line> of God, or whether I speak from <line>Myself.”</line> John 7:17, R.V. All who come <line>to</line> Christ for a clearer knowledge of <line>the</line> truth will receive it. He will unfold <line>to</line> them the mysteries of the kingdom <line>of</line> heaven, and these mysteries will be <line>understood</line> by the heart that longs to <line>know</line> the truth. A heavenly light will <line>shine</line> into the soul temple, and will be <line>revealed</line> to others as the bright shining <line>of</line> a lamp on a dark path.</p></div>

<p><line>In</line> the East the state of affairs was <line>so</line> unsettled, and there was so great <line>danger</line> from violence that the people <line>dwelt</line> chiefly in walled towns, and the <line>husbandmen</line> went forth daily to their <line>labor</line> outside the walls. So Christ, the <line>heavenly</line> Sower, went forth to sow. He <line>left</line> His home of security and peace, left <line>the</line> glory that He had with the Father <line>before</line> the world was, left His position <line>upon</line> the throne of the universe. He <line>went</line> forth, a suffering, tempted man; <line>went</line> forth in solitude, to sow in tears, <line>to</line> water with His blood, the seed of life <line>for</line> a world lost.</p></div>

<p><line>His</line> servants in like manner must go <line>forth</line> to sow. When called to become a <line>sower</line> of the seed of truth, Abraham was <line>bidden,</line> “Get thee out of thy country, and <line>from</line> thy kindred, and from thy father’s <line>house,</line> unto a land that I will show <line>thee.”</line> Genesis 12:1. “And he went out, <line>not</line> knowing whither he went.” Heb. <line>11:8.</line> So to the apostle Paul, praying <line>in</line> the temple at Jerusalem, came the <line>message</line> from God, “Depart; for I will <line>send</line> thee far hence unto the Gentiles.” <line>Acts</line> 22:21. So those who are called to <line>unite</line> with Christ must leave all, in order <line>to</line> follow Him. Old associations must <line>be</line> broken up, plans of life relinquished, <line>earthly</line> hopes surrendered. In toil and <line>tears,</line> in solitude, and through sacrifice, <line>must</line> the seed be sown.</p></div>

<p><line>Christ</line> came to sow the world with <line>truth.</line> Ever since the fall of man, Satan <line>has</line> been sowing the seeds of error. <line>It</line> was by a lie that he first gained <line>control</line> over men, and thus he still <line>works</line> to overthrow God’s kingdom in <line>the</line> earth and to bring men under his <line>power.</line> A sower from a higher world, <line>Christ</line> came to sow the seeds of truth. <line>He</line> who had stood in the councils of <line>God,</line> who had dwelt in the innermost <line>sanctuary</line> of the Eternal, could bring <line>to</line> men the pure principles of truth. <line>Ever</line> since the fall of man, Christ had <line>been</line> the Revealer of truth to the world. <line>By</line> Him the incorruptible seed, “the <line>word</line> of God, which liveth and abideth <line>forever,”</line> is communicated to men. 1 <line>Peter</line> 1:23. In that first promise spoken <line>to</line> our fallen race in Eden, Christ was <line>sowing</line> the gospel seed.

<p><line>The</line> teachers of Israel were not <line>sowing</line> the seed of the word of God. <line>Christ’s</line> work as a teacher of truth <line>was</line> in marked contrast to that of the <line>rabbis</line> of His time.

The subject of <line>Christ’s</line> teaching and preaching was <line>the</line> word of God. He met questioners <line>with</line> a plain, “It is written.” “What <line>saith</line> the Scriptures?” “How readest <line>thou?”</line> At every opportunity, when <line>an</line> interest was awakened by either <line>friend</line> or foe, He sowed the seed of <line>the</line> word.

<p><line>In</line> our day, as of old, the vital truths <line>of</line> God’s word are set aside for human <line>theories</line> and speculations. Many <line>professed</line> ministers of the gospel do <line>not</line> accept the whole Bible as the <line>inspired</line> word. One wise man rejects <line>one</line> portion; another questions another <line>part.</line> They set up their judgment as <line>superior</line> to the word; and the Scripture <line>which</line> they do teach rests upon their <line>own</line> authority. Its divine authenticity is <line>destroyed.</line> Thus the seeds of infidelity <line>are</line> sown broadcast; for the people <line>become</line> confused and know not what <line>to</line> believe. There are many beliefs that <line>the</line> mind has no right to entertain. In <line>the</line> days of Christ the rabbis put a <line>forced,</line> mystical construction upon <line>many</line> portions of Scripture. Because <line>the</line> plain teaching of God’s word <line>condemned</line> their practices, they tried <line>to</line> destroy its force. The same thing is <line>done</line> today. The word of God is made <line>to</line> appear mysterious and obscure in <line>order</line> to excuse transgression of His <line>law.</line> Christ rebuked these practices <line>in</line> His day. He taught that the word <line>of</line> God was to be understood by all. <line>He</line> pointed to the Scriptures as of <line>unquestionable</line> authority, and we <line>should</line> do the same. The Bible is to be <line>presented</line> as the word of the infinite <line>God,</line> as the end of all controversy and <line>the</line> foundation of all faith.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> Bible has been robbed of its power, <line>and</line> the results are seen in a lowering of <line>the</line> tone of spiritual life. In the sermons <line>from</line> many pulpits of today there is <line>not</line> that divine manifestation which <line>awakens</line> the conscience and brings <line>life</line> to the soul. The hearers can not <line>say,</line> “Did not our heart burn within us, <line>while</line> He talked with us by the way, and <line>while</line> He opened to us the Scriptures?” <line>Luke</line> 24:32. There are many who are <line>crying</line> out for the living God, longing <line>for</line> the divine presence. Philosophical <line>theories</line> or literary essays, however <line>brilliant,</line> cannot satisfy the heart. The <line>assertions</line> and inventions of men are of <line>no</line> value.

Let these be the <line>themes</line> of Christ’s ministers. Present <line>the</line> truth as it is in Jesus. Make plain the <line>requirements</line> of the law and the gospel. <line>Tell</line> the people of Christ’s life of self- <line>denial</line> and sacrifice; of His humiliation <line>and</line> death; of His resurrection and <line>ascension;</line> or His intercession for them <line>in</line> the courts of God; of His promise, “I <line>will</line> come again, and receive you unto <line>Myself.”</line> John 14:3.</p><p><line>Instead</line> of discussing erroneous theories, <line>or</line> seeking to combat the opponents of <line>the</line> gospel, follow the example of <line>Christ.</line> Let fresh truths from God’s <line>treasure</line> house flash into life. “Preach <line>the</line> word.” “Sow beside all waters.” “Be <line>instant</line> in season, out of season.” “He <line>that</line> hath My word, let him speak My <line>word</line> faithfully. What is the chaff to the <line>wheat?</line> saith the Lord.” “Every word of <line>God</line> is pure. . . . Add thou not unto His <line>words,</line> lest He reprove thee, and thou be <line>found</line> a liar.” 2 Tim. 4:2; Isa. 32:20; Jer. <line>23:28;</line> Prov. 30:5, 6.</p></div>

<p><line>“The</line> sower soweth the word.” Here <line>is</line> presented the great principle which <line>should</line> underlie all educational work. <line>“The</line> seed is the word of God.” But <line>in</line> too many schools of our day God’s <line>word</line> is set aside. Other subjects <line>occupy</line> the mind. The study of infidel <line>authors</line> holds a large place in the <line>educational</line> system. Skeptical senti- <line>ments</line> are interwoven in the matter <line>placed</line> in school books. Scientific <line>research</line> becomes misleading, because <line>its</line> discoveries are misinterpreted <line>and</line> perverted. The word of God is <line>compared</line> with the supposed teachings <line>of</line> science, and is made to appear <line>uncertain</line> and untrustworthy. Thus the <line>seeds</line> of doubt are planted in the minds <line>of</line> the youth, and in time of temptation <line>they</line> spring up. When faith in God’s <line>word</line> is lost, the soul has no guide, no <line>safeguard.</line> The youth are drawn into <line>paths</line> which lead away from God and <line>from</line> everlasting life.</p><p><line>To</line> this cause may in great degree be <line>attributed</line> the widespread iniquity in <line>our</line> world today. When the word of <line>God</line> is set aside, its power to restrain <line>the</line> evil passions of the natural heart is <line>rejected.</line> Men sow to the flesh, and of <line>the</line> flesh they reap corruption.</p></div>

<p><line>And</line> here, too, is the great cause of <line>mental</line> weakness and inefficiency. In <line>turning</line> from God’s word to feed on <line>the</line> writings of uninspired men, the <line>mind</line> becomes dwarfed and cheapened. <line>It</line> is not brought in contact with deep, <line>broad</line> principles of eternal truth. The <line>understanding</line> adapts itself to the <line>comprehension</line> of the things with <line>which</line> it is familiar, and in this devotion <line>to</line> finite things it is weakened, its <line>power</line> is contracted, and after a time it <line>becomes</line> unable to expand.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> work of every teacher should <line>be</line> to fasten the mind of the youth <line>upon</line> the grand truths of the word <line>of</line> Inspiration.

It will strengthen and <line>fortify</line> the mind against temptation, and <line>fit</line> the learner to become a co-worker with <line>Christ</line> in His mission of mercy to the <line>world.</line> It will make him a member of the <line>heavenly</line> family; and prepare him to share <line>the</line> inheritance of the saints in light.</p></div>

<p><line>But</line> the teacher of sacred truth can <line>impart</line> only that which he himself <line>knows</line> by experience. “The sower <line>sowed</line> [his] seed.” Christ taught the <line>truth</line> because He was the truth. His <line>own</line> thought, His character, His life- <line>experience,</line> were embodied in His <line>teaching.</line> So with His servants: those <line>who</line> would teach the word are to make <line>it</line> their own by a personal experience. <line>They</line> must know what it is to have <line>Christ</line> made unto them wisdom and <line>righteousness</line> and sanctification and <line>redemption.</line> In presenting the word <line>of</line> God to others, they are not to make <line>it</line> a suppose-so or a maybe. They <line>should</line> declare with the apostle Peter, <line>“We</line> have not followed cunningly <line>devised</line> fables when we made known <line>unto</line> you the power and coming of <line>our</line> Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye- <line>witnesses</line> of His majesty.” 2 Peter <line>1:16.</line> Every minister of Christ and <line>every</line> teacher should be able to say <line>with</line> the beloved John, “The life was <line>manifested,</line> and we have seen it, and <line>bear</line> witness, and show unto you that <line>eternal</line> life which was with the Father, <line>and</line> was manifested unto us.” 1 John 1:2.</p></div>
