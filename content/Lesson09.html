                <p><line>Among</line> the Jews leaven was sometimes <line>used</line> as an emblem of sin. At the time of <line>the</line> Passover the people were directed to <line>remove</line> all the leaven from their houses <line>as</line> they were to put away sin from their <line>hearts.</line> Christ warned His disciples, <line>“Beware</line> ye of the leaven of the <line>Pharisees,</line> which is hypocrisy.” Luke <line>12:1.</line> And the apostle Paul speaks of <line>the</line> “leaven of malice and wickedness.” <line>I</line> Corinthians 5:8.

                <p><line>The</line> great truth of the conversion of the <line>heart</line> by the Holy Spirit is presented in <line>Christ’s</line> words to Nicodemus. “Verily, <line>verily,</line> I say unto thee, Except a man be <line>born</line> again, he cannot see the kingdom <line>of</line> God. . . That which is born of the <line>flesh</line> is flesh; and that which is born <line>of</line> the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I <line>said</line> unto thee, Ye must be born again. <line>The</line> wind bloweth where it listeth, <line>and</line> thou hearest the sound thereof, <line>but</line> canst not tell whence it cometh, <line>and</line> whither it goeth: so is every one <line>that</line> is born of the Spirit.” The apostle <line>Paul,</line> writing by the Holy Spirit, says, <line>“God,</line> who is rich in mercy, for His <line>great</line> love wherewith He loved us, <line>even</line> when we were dead in sins, hath <line>quickened</line> us together with Christ, <line>(by</line> grace ye are saved;) and hath <line>raised</line> us up together, and made us sit <line>together</line> in heavenly places in Christ <line>Jesus:</line> that in the ages to come He <line>might</line> show the exceeding riches of <line>His</line> grace in His kindness toward us <line>through</line> Christ Jesus. For by grace are <line>ye</line> saved through faith; and that not <line>of</line> yourselves; it is the gift of God.” <line>Ephesians</line> 2:4-8.</p>

                <p><line>The</line> world regards as a mystery the man <line>who</line> is imbued with this principle. The <line>selfish,</line> money-loving man lives only <line>to</line> secure for himself the riches, honors, <line>and</line> pleasures of this world. He loses <line>the</line> eternal world from his reckoning. <line>But</line> with the follower of Christ these <line>things</line> will not be all-absorbing. For <line>Christ’s</line> sake he will labor and deny <line>self,</line> that he may aid in the great work <line>of</line> saving souls who are without Christ <line>and</line> without hope in the world. Such a <line>man</line> the world cannot understand; for <line>he</line> is keeping in view eternal realities. <line>The</line> love of Christ with its redeeming <line>power</line> has come into the heart. This <line>love</line> masters every other motive, and <line>raises</line> its possessor above the corrupting <line>influence</line> of the world.</p>

                <p><line>The</line> word of God is to have a sancti- <line>fying</line> effect on our association with <line>every</line> member of the human family. <line>The</line> leaven of truth will not produce <line>the</line> spirit of rivalry, the love of am- <line>bition,</line> the desire to be first. True, <line>heaven-born</line> love is not selfish and <line>changeable.</line> It is not dependent on <line>human</line> praise. The heart of him who <line>receives</line> the grace of God overflows <line>with</line> love for God and for those for <line>whom</line> Christ died. Self is not strug- <line>gling</line> for recognition. He does not <line>love</line> others because they love and <line>please</line> him, because they appreci- <line>ate</line> his merits, but because they are <line>Christ’s</line> purchased possession. If his <line>motives,</line> words, or actions are misun- <line>derstood</line> or misrepresented, he takes <line>no</line> offense, but pursues the even tenor <line>of</line> his way. He is kind and thoughtful, <line>humble</line> in his opinion of himself, yet <line>full</line> of hope, always trusting in the <line>mercy</line> and love of God.</p>
