<hr/><p class="note">The parable of the sower excited much questioning. Some of the hearers gathered from it that Christ was not to establish an earthly kingdom, and many were curious and perplexed. Seeing their perplexity, Christ used other illustrations, still seeking to turn their thoughts from the hope of a worldly kingdom to the work of God’s grace in the soul.</p>

<p><line>The</line> husbandman who “putteth in the <line>sickle,</line> because the harvest is come,” <line>can</line> be no other than Christ. It is He who <line>at</line> the last great day will reap the harvest <line>of</line> the earth. But the sower of the seed <line>represents</line> those who labor in Christ’s <line>stead.</line> The seed is said to “spring and <line>grow</line> up, he knoweth not how,” and <line>this</line> is not true of the Son of God. <line>Christ</line> does not sleep over His charge, <line>but</line> watches it day and night. He is not <line>ignorant</line> of how the seed grows.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> parable of the seed reveals that <line>God</line> is at work in nature. The seed <line>has</line> in itself a germinating principle, <line>a</line> principle that God Himself has <line>implanted;</line> yet if left to itself the seed <line>would</line> have no power to spring up. <line>Man</line> has his part to act in promoting <line>the</line> growth of the grain. He must <line>prepare</line> and enrich the soil and cast in <line>the</line> seed. He must till the fields. But <line>there</line> is a point beyond which he can <line>accomplish</line> nothing. No strength or <line>wisdom</line> of man can bring forth from <line>the</line> seed the living plant. Let man put <line>forth</line> his efforts to the utmost limit, <line>he</line> must still depend upon One who <line>has</line> connected the sowing and the <line>reaping</line> by wonderful links of His own <line>omnipotent</line> power.</p></div>

<p><line>There</line> is life in the seed, there is <line>power</line> in the soil; but unless an <line>infinite</line> power is exercised day and <line>night,</line> the seed will yield no returns. <line>The</line> showers of rain must be sent to <line>give</line> moisture to the thirsty fields, the <line>sun</line> must impart heat, electricity must <line>be</line> conveyed to the buried seed.

<p><line>As</line> in the natural, so in the spiritual <line>sowing;</line> the teacher of truth must seek <line>to</line> prepare the soil of the heart; he must <line>sow</line> the seed; but the power that alone <line>can</line> produce life is from God. There is <line>a</line> point beyond which human effort is <line>in</line> vain. While we are to preach the <line>word,</line> we can not impart the power <line>that</line> will quicken the soul, and cause <line>righteousness</line> and praise to spring forth. <line>In</line> the preaching of the word there must <line>be</line> the working of an agency beyond <line>any</line> human power. Only through the <line>divine</line> Spirit will the word be living <line>and</line> powerful to renew the soul unto <line>eternal</line> life. This is what Christ tried to <line>impress</line> upon His disciples. He taught <line>that</line> it was nothing they possessed in <line>themselves</line> which would give success <line>to</line> their labors, but that it is the miracle- <line>working</line> power of God which gives <line>efficiency</line> to His own word.</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> work of the sower is a work of <line>faith.</line> The mystery of the germination <line>and</line> growth of the seed he cannot <line>understand.</line> But he has confidence <line>in</line> the agencies by which God causes <line>vegetation</line> to flourish. In casting his <line>seed</line> into the ground, he is apparently <line>throwing</line> away the precious grain that <line>might</line> furnish bread for his family. But <line>he</line> is only giving up a present good for <line>a</line> larger return. He casts the seed away, <line>expecting</line> to gather it manyfold in an <line>abundant</line> harvest.

<p><line>The</line> good seed may for a time lie <line>unnoticed</line> in a cold, selfish, worldly <line>heart,</line> giving no evidence that it has <line>taken</line> root; but afterward, as the Spirit <line>of</line> God breathes on the soul, the hidden <line>seed</line> springs up, and at last bears fruit <line>to</line> the glory of God. In our lifework <line>we</line> know not which shall prosper, <line>this</line> or that. This is not a question for <line>us</line> to settle. We are to do our work, <line>and</line> leave the results with God. “In <line>the</line> morning sow thy seed, and in the <line>evening</line> withhold not thine hand.” Eccl. <line>11:6.</line> God’s great covenant declares <line>that</line> “while the earth remaineth, seed- <line>time</line> and harvest . . . shall not cease.” <line>Gen.</line> 8:22. In the confidence of this <line>promise</line> the husbandman tills and <line>sows.</line> Not less confidently are we in the <line>spiritual</line> sowing to labor, trusting His <line>assurance,</line> “So shall My word be that <line>goeth</line> forth out of My mouth; it shall <line>not</line> return unto Me void, but it shall <line>accomplish</line> that which I please, and it <line>shall</line> prosper in the thing whereto I sent <line>it.”</line> “He that goeth forth and weepeth, <line>bearing</line> precious seed, shall doubtless <line>come</line> again with rejoicing, bringing his <line>sheaves</line> with him.”</p></div>

<p><line>The</line> germination of the seed represents <line>the</line> beginning of spiritual life, and the <line>development</line> of the plant is a beautiful <line>figure</line> of Christian growth. As in <line>nature,</line> so in grace; there can be no life <line>without</line> growth. The plant must either <line>grow</line> or die. As its growth is silent and <line>imperceptible,</line> but continuous, so is <line>the</line> development of the Christian life. <line>At</line> every stage of development our life <line>may</line> be perfect; yet if God’s purpose for <line>us</line> is fulfilled, there will be continual <line>advancement.</line> Sanctification is the <line>work</line> of a lifetime.

<p><line>The</line> plant grows by receiving that <line>which</line> God has provided to sustain its <line>life.</line> It sends down its roots into the <line>earth.</line> It drinks in the sunshine, the <line>dew,</line> and the rain. It receives the life- <line>giving</line> properties from the air. So the <line>Christian</line> is to grow by cooperating <line>with</line> the divine agencies. Feeling our <line>helplessness,</line> we are to improve all <line>the</line> opportunities granted us to gain a <line>fuller</line> experience. As the plant takes <line>root</line> in the soil, so we are to take deep <line>root</line> in Christ. As the plant receives <line>the</line> sunshine, the dew, and the rain, <line>we</line> are to open our hearts to the Holy <line>Spirit.</line> The work is to be done “not by <line>might,</line> nor by power, but by My Spirit, <line>saith</line> the Lord of hosts.” If we keep <line>our</line> minds stayed upon Christ, He will <line>come</line> unto us “as the rain, as the latter <line>and</line> former rain unto the earth.” Hosea <line>6:3.</line> As the Sun of Righteousness, He <line>will</line> arise upon us “with healing in His <line>wings.”</line> Malachi 4:2. We shall “grow as <line>the</line> lily.” We shall “revive as the corn, <line>and</line> grow as the vine.” Hosea 14:5, 7. <line>By</line> constantly relying upon Christ as our <line>personal</line> Saviour, we shall grow up into <line>Him</line> in all things who is our head.</p></div>
