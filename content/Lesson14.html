<p><line>From</line> hours spent with God He came <line>forth</line> morning by morning, to bring <line>the</line> light of heaven to men.

<p><line>Then</line> in a parable he illustrated the <line>lesson</line> he desired to teach them. “Which <line>of</line> you,” he said, “shall have a friend, <line>and</line> shall go unto him at midnight, <line>and</line> say unto him, Friend, lend me <line>three</line> loaves; for a friend of mine in <line>his</line> journey is come to me, and I have <line>nothing</line> to set before him? And he from <line>within</line> shall answer and say, Trouble <line>me</line> not: the door is now shut, and my <line>children</line> are with me in bed; I can not <line>rise</line> and give thee. I say unto you, <line>Though</line> he will not rise and give him, <line>because</line> he is his friend, yet because of <line>his</line> importunity he will rise and give <line>him</line> as many as he needeth.”</p><p><line>Here</line> Christ represents the petitioner <line>as</line> asking that he may give again. <line>He</line> must obtain the bread, else he <line>can</line> not supply the necessities of a <line>weary,</line> belated wayfarer. Though his <line>neighbor</line> is unwilling to be troubled, <line>he</line> will not desist his pleading; his <line>friend</line> must be relieved.

<p><line>In</line> like manner the disciples were <line>to</line> seek blessings from God. In the <line>feeding</line> of the multitude and in the <line>sermon</line> on the bread from heaven, <line>Christ</line> had opened to them their work <line>as</line> his representatives. They were to <line>give</line> the bread of life to the people. <line>He</line> who had appointed their work, <line>saw</line> how often their faith would be <line>tried.</line> Often they would be thrown <line>into</line> unexpected positions, and would <line>realize</line> their human insufficiency. <line>Souls</line> that were hungering for the <line>bread</line> of life would come to them, <line>and</line> they would feel themselves to <line>the</line> destitute and helpless. They must <line>receive</line> spiritual food, or they would <line>have</line> nothing to impart. But they <line>were</line> not to turn one soul away unfed. <line>Christ</line> directs them to the source of <line>supply.</line> The man whose friend came <line>to</line> him for entertainment, even at the <line>unseasonable</line> hour of midnight, did <line>not</line> turn him away. He had nothing <line>to</line> set before him, but he went to one <line>who</line> had food, and pressed his request, <line>until</line> the neighbor supplied his need. <line>And</line> would not God, who had sent his <line>servants</line> to feed the hungry, supply <line>their</line> need for his own work?</p></div>

<p><line>But</line> the selfish neighbor in the parable <line>does</line> not represent the character of <line>God.</line> The lesson is drawn, not by <line>comparison,</line> but by contrast. A selfish <line>man</line> will grant an urgent request, <line>in</line> order to rid himself of one who <line>disturbs</line> his rest. But God delights to <line>give.</line> He is full of compassion, and he <line>longs</line> to grant the requests of those who <line>come</line> unto him in faith.

<p><line>God</line> regards us as His children.

<p><line>Our</line> prayers are not to be a selfish <line>asking,</line> merely for our own benefit. <line>We</line> are to ask that we may give. The <line>principle</line> of Christ’s life must be the <line>principle</line> of our lives. “For their sakes,” <line>He</line> said, speaking of His disciples, “I <line>sanctify</line> Myself, that they also might <line>be</line> sanctified.” John 17:19. The same <line>devotion,</line> the same self-sacrifice, the <line>same</line> subjection to the claims of the <line>word</line> of God, that were manifest in <line>Christ,</line> must be seen in His servants. <line>Our</line> mission to the world is not to <line>serve</line> or please ourselves; we are to <line>glorify</line> God by cooperating with Him <line>to</line> save sinners. We are to ask blessings <line>from</line> God that we may communicate <line>to</line> others. The capacity for receiving <line>is</line> preserved only by imparting.

<p><line>In</line> the parable the petitioner was again <line>and</line> again repulsed, but he did not <line>relinquish</line> his purpose. So our prayers <line>do</line> not always seem to receive an <line>immediate</line> answer; but Christ teaches <line>that</line> we should not cease to pray. Prayer <line>is</line> not to work any change in God; it <line>is</line> to bring us into harmony with God. <line>When</line> we make request of Him, He may <line>see</line> that it is necessary for us to search <line>our</line> hearts and repent of sin. Therefore <line>He</line> takes us through test and trial, He <line>brings</line> us through humiliation, that we <line>may</line> see what hinders the working of <line>His</line> Holy Spirit through us.</p></div>

<p><line>There</line> are conditions to the fulfillment <line>of</line> God’s promises, and prayer can <line>never</line> take the place of duty. “If ye <line>love</line> Me,” Christ says, “Keep My <line>commandments.”</line> “He that hath My <line>commandments,</line> and keepeth them, he <line>it</line> is that loveth Me; and he that loveth <line>Me</line> shall be loved of My Father, and I <line>will</line> love him, and will manifest Myself <line>to</line> him.” John 14:15, 21.

<p><line>Many</line> are forfeiting the condition of <line>acceptance</line> with the Father. We need <line>to</line> examine closely the deed of trust <line>wherewith</line> we approach God.

<p><line>As</line> the Giver of every blessing, God <line>claims</line> a certain portion of all we <line>possess.</line> This is His provision to sustain <line>the</line> preaching of the gospel. And by <line>making</line> this return to God, we are to <line>show</line> our appreciation of His gifts. But if <line>we</line> withhold from Him that which is His <line>own,</line> how can we claim His blessing? <line>If</line> we are unfaithful stewards of earthly <line>things,</line> how can we expect Him to entrust <line>us</line> with the things of heaven? It may be <line>that</line> here is the secret of unanswered <line>prayer.</line> But the Lord in His great mercy <line>is</line> ready to forgive, and He says, “Bring <line>ye</line> all the tithes into the storehouse, that <line>there</line> may be meat in Mine house, and <line>prove</line> Me now herewith, . . . if I will not <line>open</line> you the windows of heaven, and <line>pour</line> you out a blessing, that there shall <line>not</line> be room enough to receive it. And I <line>will</line> rebuke the devourer for your sakes, <line>and</line> he shall not destroy the fruits of your <line>ground;</line> neither shall your vine cast her <line>fruit</line> before the time in the field. . . . And <line>all</line> nations shall call you blessed; for ye <line>shall</line> be a delightsome land, saith the <line>Lord</line> of hosts.” Mal. 3:10-12.</p><p><line>So</line> it is with every other one of God’s <line>requirements.</line> All His gifts are promised <line>on</line> condition of obedience. God has a <line>heaven</line> full of blessings for those who <line>will</line> cooperate with Him.

<p><line>But</line> we must show a firm, undeviating <line>trust</line> in God. Often He delays to answer <line>us</line> in order to try our faith or test the <line>genuineness</line> of our desire. Having <line>asked</line> according to His word, we <line>should</line> believe His promise and press <line>our</line> petitions with a determination that <line>will</line> not be denied.</p><p><line>God</line> does not say, Ask once, and you shall <line>receive.</line> He bids us ask. Unwearyingly <line>persist</line> in prayer. The persistent asking <line>brings</line> the petitioner into a more earnest <line>attitude,</line> and gives him an increased desire to <line>receive</line> the things for which he asks. Christ <line>said</line> to Martha at the grave of Lazarus, “If <line>thou</line> wouldest believe, thou shouldest see <line>the</line> glory of God.” John 11:40.</p><p><line>But</line> many have not a living faith. This is <line>why</line> they do not see more of the power <line>of</line> God. Their weakness is the result of <line>their</line> unbelief. They have more faith in <line>their</line> own working than in the working <line>of</line> God for them. They take themselves <line>into</line> their own keeping. They plan and <line>devise,</line> but pray little, and have little <line>real</line> trust in God. They think they have <line>faith,</line> but it is only the impulse of the <line>moment.</line> Failing to realize their own <line>need,</line> or God’s willingness to give, <line>they</line> do not persevere in keeping their <line>requests</line> before the Lord.</p><p><line>Our</line> prayers are to be as earnest and <line>persistent</line> as was the petition of the <line>needy</line> friend who asked for the loaves <line>at</line> midnight. The more earnestly and <line>steadfastly</line> we ask, the closer will be <line>our</line> spiritual union with Christ. We shall <line>receive</line> increased blessings because we <line>have</line> increased faith.</p></div>
